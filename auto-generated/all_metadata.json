These factors may also affect the age and sex structure of the population.\n\nPart of a [series of UK Perspectives][1] providing an overview of key aspects of the nation over the last three decades, this article presents some key statistics relating to the changing UK population.\n##1. The UK population has grown by 7.8 million since 1980\n####Mid-year population estimates for the UK, 1980 to 2013\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc222/Pop_Chart1/Pop_Chart1.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Mid-year population estimates for the UK, 1980 to 2013\"/>\n\n[download the data][2]\n\nSince 1980, the UK population has grown by 7.8 million people (13.8%). Around half of this growth has occurred since 2005, due to an increase in the number of births and an increase in net inward migration following the EU expansion in 2004.\n##2. What is driving UK population growth?\n####Factors driving UK population change, mid-year estimates, 1992 to 2013^1^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc222/Pop_Chart2/Pop_Chart2.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Factors driving UK population change, mid-year estimates, 1992 to 2013^1^\"/>\n\n[download the data][3]\n\nBetween 1999 and 2011 net migration was the main component of population change in the UK. However, births have exceeded deaths throughout the last two decades and since 2002 there has been a marked increase in the number of births, with 2012 having the highest number since 1972. The increase in the number of births has been driven both by the immigration of women who are currently of childbearing age and by rising fertility among UK-born women^2^.\n\nIn the year to mid-2013, the population increased by 400,600. 212,100 or 53% of this increase was due to natural change or the difference between births and deaths. 183,400 or 46% of the increase was due to net international migration which is the difference between international immigration and international emigration during the year.\n\nCurrent and past international migration also has indirect effects on the size of the population as it changes the numbers of births and deaths in the UK. For example, statistics on the number of births by the country of birth of the mother show that 196,777 live births (25% of total live births) in the UK in 2013 were to mothers born outside the UK.\n\nFor more analysis of these changes, please see this article on [Migration to the UK][4].\n##3. The UK's ageing population: life expectancy predicted to rise steadily for men and women\n####Cohort life expectancy at birth, UK, 1980 to 2037\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc222/Pop_Chart3/Pop_Chart3.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Cohort life expectancy at birth, UK, 1980 to 2037\"/>\n\n[download the data][5]\n\nA boy born in the UK in 1980 could expect to live 84.7 years on average. For a boy born today (2015) the figure is 91.0 years and, based on current assumptions, by 2037 it is projected to be 94.3 years.\n\nSimilarly, a girl born in 1980 could expect to live 88.8 years on average. For a girl born today (2015) the figure is 94.3 years and, based on current assumptions, by 2037 it is projected to be 97.3 years.\n\nWith life expectancy increasing, the UK’s population will age. This will affect a number of policy areas, including pensions and the health service – particularly because healthy life expectancy is not increasing as quickly.\n##4. Changes to state pension age impacts the old age dependency ratio\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The old age dependency ratio (OADR) measures the number of people of State Pension Age (SPA) and over for every 1,000 people of working age (16 to SPA). The OADR provides an idea of the relationship between working and pensioner populations.</ons-box>\n\n####Old age dependency ratio (OADR), UK, 1980 to 2037 ^3,4,5^ \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc222/Pop_Chart4/Pop_Chart4.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Old age dependency ratio (OADR),Â� UK, 1980 to 2037 ^3,4,5^Â�\"/>\n\n[download the data][7]\n\nThe OADR was steady at around 300 from the 1980s to 2006, but rose in 2007-09 as women born in the post-World War II baby boom reached SPA. In the absence of any increases to SPA, it would reach 487 by 2037; but, as a result of planned SPA increases taking place between 2010 and 2046 under current legislation, it is expected that – for every 1,000 people of working age in 2037 – there will be 365 people of SPA.\n\nThe increase in the OADR means there will be fewer people of working age to support a larger population over SPA.\n##5. The number of UK residents aged 90 and over has almost tripled since the early 1980s\n####UK residents aged 90 and over per 100,000 UK residents, 1983 to 2013\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc222/Pop_Chart5/Pop_Chart5.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK residents aged 90 and over per 100,000 UK residents, 1983 toÂ� 2013\"/>\n\n[download the data][8]\n\nAlthough the 90 and over group account for only a very small proportion of the UK population (0.8% in 2013), the size of this age group relative to the rest has increased over time. This illustrates the UK’s ageing population.\n##Conclusion: An increasing and ageing population\nThe UK population is both increasing and ageing. Current projections show this pattern is set to continue. By 2037, it is projected to reach 73.3 million.\n\nThat's an increase of 9.2 million (13%) compared with 2013 as a result of births minus deaths, plus net migration.\n\nWhile a larger population increases the size and productive capacity of the workforce, it also increases demand for education, healthcare and housing.\n\nMeanwhile, longer life expectancy is resulting in a growing older population. People working longer will increase the size of the labour force, but there will also be further pressure on services.  The old age dependency ratio is expected to increase in future years, although planned changes to the State Pension Age will slow this increase.\n\nPlease see related links for other relevant data sources and analysis.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: [better.info@ons.gov.uk][9]\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-perspectives-an-introduction/\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/01/Pop_Chart1.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/01/Pop_Chart21.csv\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/internationalmigrationarecenthistory/2015-01-15\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/01/Pop_Chart3.csv\n  [6]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pensions/pension-trends/chapter-2--population-change--2012-edition-/index.html\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2014/12/Pop_Chart4.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/01/Pop_Chart5.csv\n  [9]: mailto:better.info@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1. Net international migration includes other small population changes, such as changes to armed forces between UK and overseas.\n2. This sentence was updated on 16/1/15 to correct inaccurate wording.\n3. This chart is an update to the OADR chart found in [Pension Trends, Chapter 2: Population change (2012 edition)][6]. Here the OADR from 1980 to 2013 is based on 2013 mid-year estimates. From 2014, the OADR uses 2012-based mid-year projections.\n4. Population projections are uncertain and become increasingly uncertain the further they are carried forward in time. They do not attempt to predict the impact that future government policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors might have on demographic behaviour.\n5. SPA changes are those contained in the Pensions Acts 1995, 2007 and 2011, but do not take into account changes in the Pensions Act 2014, or proposed future changes to the state pension age that are yet to become law. For the purposes of this analysis, the changes are applied to the UK population, although it should be noted that pensions in Northern Ireland are a devolved matter"

The number of UK residents aged 90 and over has almost tripled since the early 1980s\n####UK residents aged 90 and over per 100,000 UK residents, 1983 to 2013\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc222/Pop_Chart5/Pop_Chart5.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK residents aged 90 and over per 100,000 UK residents, 1983 toÂ� 2013\"/>\n\n[download the data][8]\n\nAlthough the 90 and over group account for only a very small proportion of the UK population (0.8% in 2013), the size of this age group relative to the rest has increased over time. This illustrates the UK’s ageing population.\n##Conclusion: An increasing and ageing population\nThe UK population is both increasing and ageing. Current projections show this pattern is set to continue. By 2037, it is projected to reach 73.3 million.\n\nThat's an increase of 9.2 million (13%) compared with 2013 as a result of births minus deaths, plus net migration.\n\nWhile a larger population increases the size and productive capacity of the workforce, it also increases demand for education, healthcare and housing.\n\nMeanwhile, longer life expectancy is resulting in a growing older population. People working longer will increase the size of the labour force, but there will also be further pressure on services.  The old age dependency ratio is expected to increase in future years, although planned changes to the State Pension Age will slow this increase.\n\nPlease see related links for other relevant data sources and analysis.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: [better.info@ons.gov.uk][9]\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-perspectives-an-introduction/\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/01/Pop_Chart1.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/01/Pop_Chart21.csv\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/internationalmigrationarecenthistory/2015-01-15\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/01/Pop_Chart3.csv\n  [6]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pensions/pension-trends/chapter-2--population-change--2012-edition-/index.html\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2014/12/Pop_Chart4.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/01/Pop_Chart5.csv\n  [9]: mailto:better.info@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1. Net international migration includes other small population changes, such as changes to armed forces between UK and overseas.\n2. This sentence was updated on 16/1/15 to correct inaccurate wording.\n3. This chart is an update to the OADR chart found in [Pension Trends, Chapter 2: Population change (2012 edition)][6]. Here the OADR from 1980 to 2013 is based on 2013 mid-year estimates. From 2014, the OADR uses 2012-based mid-year projections.\n4. Population projections are uncertain and become increasingly uncertain the further they are carried forward in time. They do not attempt to predict the impact that future government policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors might have on demographic behaviour.\n5. SPA changes are those contained in the Pensions Acts 1995, 2007 and 2011, but do not take into account changes in the Pensions Act 2014, or proposed future changes to the state pension age that are yet to become law. For the purposes of this analysis, the changes are applied to the UK population, although it should be noted that pensions in Northern Ireland are a devolved matter"

      "markdown": "Spending by the UK Government currently accounts for around 40% of GDP. The way public funds are allocated impacts the provision and delivery of services (like health, pensions and benefits), and therefore affects people’s day to day lives.\n\nThis article - the latest in the [UK Perspectives series][1] - presents key statistics showing changes in government spending over the last two decades, and takes a closer look at some aspects of the largest spending categories.\n##1. Changes in public spending over time\n####Total UK government managed spending and government managed spending as % of GDP (in 2013-14 real terms), 1993-94 to 2013-14 ^1^ \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc224/Public_Chart1/Public_Chart1.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Total UK government managed spending and government managed spending as % of GDP (in 2013-14 real terms), 1993-94 to 2013-14 ^1^\"/>\n\n[Download the data for this chart.][2]\n\n<svg height=\"110\" width=\"100%\">\n<text x=\"0\" y=\"65\" font-size=\"90\" font-family=\"Open Sans\" font-weight=\"bold\">£720</text>\n<text x=\"0\" y=\"100\" font-size=\"22\" font-family=\"Open Sans\">Billion, government spending</text>\n</svg>\n\n- Total government spending has increased in real terms each year apart from four since 1993-94, and it reached a high of £738.7 billion in 2010-11.\n- In 2013-14 government spending was £720.4 billion, the lowest it has been since 2008-09 in real terms.\n- Since 2009-10, government spending as a percentage of GDP has fallen from 45.3% to 41.6% in 2013-14.\n\n##2. Share of spending on health has increased over last 20 years\n####Proportions of total UK government spending by function (in 2013-14 real terms), £billions (and as a percentage of total) 1993-94 and 2013-14 ^2^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc224/Public_Chart2/Public_Chart2.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportions of total UK government spending by function (in 2013-14 real terms), Â£billions (and as a percentage of total) 1993-94 and 2013-14 ^2^\"/>\n[Download the data for this chart.][3]\n\nSince 1993-94 the top three spending categories have been social protection, health and education. They all have a higher proportion of government spending than they did 20 years ago.\n\nHealth spending increased steadily and had the largest increase proportionally, increasing from 13.5% to 19.2% of all government spending in 2013-14.\n\nSocial protection (pensions and benefits) spending was the largest public spending category totalling £250.6 billion in 2013-14. Spending on social protection was 37.2% in 2013-14, up from 36.2% in 1993-94.\n\nEducation was the third largest area of government spending and proportionately, this has grown slightly over the last 20 years. Whereas spending on defence and public order and safety, which includes policing and crime prevention, has fallen as a share of all spending.\n##3. Pensions spending increased over last 5 years\n####Proportions of UK social protection spending by category (in real terms), 2009-10 and 2013-14 ^3^ \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc224/Public_Chart3/Public_Chart3.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportions of UK social protection spending by category (in real terms), 2009-10 and 2013-14 ^3^\"/>\n[Download the data for this chart.][4]\n\n[data number=\"£251\" description=\"Billion, social protection spending\"]\n\nPensions was the largest type of social protection spending and its share of total spending has increased over the last five years. Increased spending on pensions in particular reflects [the UK’s growing and ageing population][5]. Government policies on the state pension age affect the number people who qualify for a state pension and therefore, the overall level of spending on pensions that is required. [Forecasts by the Pensions Commission][6] have suggested that, following changes in state pension age, spending on pensions will increase by around 1.5 percentage points by 2050.\n\nThe share of spending on family, income support and tax credits has fallen the most over the same period.\n##4. Healthcare funds mainly spent on medical services\n####Proportion of UK spending on healthcare categories, 2013-14 ^4^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc224/Public_Chart4/Public_Chart4.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of UK spending on healthcare categories, 2013-14 ^4^\"/>\n[Download the data for this chart.][8]\n\nThe vast majority of total healthcare spending was used for medical services in 2013-14 (95.6%). Spending on medical services includes the costs of running hospitals, GP surgeries and outpatients services, and has accounted for at least 95% of total healthcare spending in each of the last five years.\n\nSpending on medical research comprised the smallest share of total healthcare spending and in 2013-14 accounted for 0.7%. Spending in this area has been decreasing steadily since 2009-10, in 2010-11 it was 1.5% and in 2012-13 was 1.1%.\n##5. Secondary education made up largest share of education spending\n####Proportion of UK spending on four education categories, 2009-10 to 2013-14 ^5^ \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc224/Public_Chart5/Public_Chart5.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of UK spending on four education categories, 2009-10 to 2013-14 ^5^\"/>\n\n[Download the data for this chart.][9]\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Spending on education at all levels includes: operation and support of schools, administration and inspections.</ons-box>\n\nSpending on secondary education accounted for two fifths of all government spending on education in 2013-14, continuing similar levels to the previous four years. Primary education accounted for 30% of all education spending in 2013-14 while further and higher (tertiary) education spending had a 17% share.\n\nIn 2012 the Government changed the structure of higher education funding so that universities can decide how much to charge students on tuition fees, up to £9,000 a year. There are also costs on providing financial support for students, either in the form of loans or grants for students from low income backgrounds. Despite these changes to funding structure, the share of spending on further and higher education has changed relatively little in recent years but increased from 15.5% in 2012-13 to 17.0% in 2013-14.\n##6. Increases in military equipment spending since 2007-08\n####Estimated UK defence spending by manufacturing industry, 2007-08 to 2012-13\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc224/Public_Chart6/Public_Chart6.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Estimated UK defence spending by manufacturing industry, 2007-08 to 2012-13\"/>\n[Download the data for this chart.][10]\n\nSince 2007-08, spending on military equipment for weapons and ammunition, shipbuilding and repairing, and aircraft and spacecraft has increased. The amount spent on shipbuilding and repairing has increased the most with a 91% increase to around £2.1 billion in 2012-13.\n\nGovernment spending on defence services also relates to the costs of employing armed forces personnel. Therefore the amount spent on defence in general tends to reflect the size of the UK’s armed forces, which have been reducing in size in recent years. In 2013-14 there were 159,600 [UK service personnel][11], a fall of more than 27,000 over the last five years.\n##Conclusion: Public spending reflects changing demands\nThere have been some large changes to the amount of government spending on different types of public service in the last 20 years. In particular, spending on health and pensions has played an increasingly important role over time as the UK’s population increases and gets older.\n\nChanges in government spending can be driven by requirements for public services like healthcare and pensions, as well as by policies initiated by government. In the future, the changing needs of the country’s population will help determine how public money is spent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-perspectives-an-introduction/\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/Pubsector_1.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/Pubsector_2.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/Pubsector_3.csv\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/migrationwithintheuk/articles/thechangingukpopulation/2015-01-15\n  [6]: http://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20070802120000/http:/www.pensionscommission.org.uk/publications/2006/final-report/final_report.pdf\n  [7]: http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcs.asp?Cl=4&Lg=1&Co=09\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/Pubsector_4.csv\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/Pubsector_5.csv\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/Pubsector_6.csv\n  [11]: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-armed-forces-annual-manning-statistics-index\n  [12]: mailto:better.info@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

In terms of disposable income, the richest fifth of households have seen the greatest percentage increase in their incomes, while incomes for the poorest fifth have increased at a slower rate.\n\nConsidering more recent figures, since the financial year ending 2008, the average (median) income across all households has fallen by 5% (after accounting for inflation). Although the richest fifth of households followed this general decline, incomes for the poorest fifth have actually risen by 3%.\n##3. The percentage of people living in relative low income has been falling over time\n####Percentage of people living in relative low income, UK, financial year ending 1999 to financial year ending 2013\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Households with income below 60% of the median UK household income in the year the data is collected are considered to be living in relative low income in that year.</ons-box>\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc230/Finance_Chart3/Finance_Chart3.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of people living in relative low income, UK,Â� financial year ending 1999 to financial year ending 2013 \"\"\"\"\"\"\"/>\n\n[Download the data for this chart.][4]\n\nThere were 2.3 million children living in relative low income in the UK in the financial year ending 2013 (17% of all children). This is a fall from 26% in the financial year ending 1999.\n\nA similar percentage of pensioners were living in relative low income in the financial year ending 2013 (16%). This has also fallen since the financial year ending 1999 when it stood at 27%.\n\nFinally, there were 5.5 million working-age adults living in relative low income in the financial year ending 2013 (15% of all working-age adults). This has changed little since the financial year ending 1999.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that falls in the number and percentage of people living in relative low income in part reflects the recent falls in median income. This means the relative low income definition based on 60% of median income, has fallen. Therefore, these reductions do not necessarily reflect an increase in the standard of living.\n##4. The cost of living: how does the growth in pay compare to inflation?\nHere we compare the growth in regular pay^3^ with the growth in the price level (the rate of inflation).\n\nWe use the growth in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) to represent the rate of inflation as this is the headline measure of inflation in the UK^4^.\n\n####Annual growth rates in average weekly regular pay in Great Britain and the UK Consumer Prices Index (CPI), 2001 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc230/Finance_Chart4/Finance_Chart4.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Annual growth rates in average weekly regular pay in Great BritainÂ� and the UK Consumer Prices Index (CPI), 2001 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data for this chart.][5]\n\nHistorically the annual growth in average weekly regular pay has tended to be higher than the inflation rate. However from late 2009 to mid-2014 the inflation rate was above the annual change in average weekly regular pay in Great Britain.\n\nMore recent data has shown the annual change in average weekly regular pay exceeding the inflation rate leading to a “real” increase in wages. This has been partly because of an upturn in the annual growth rate of the average weekly regular pay and partly because of falls in the inflation rate. In fact in the year to December 2014, the UK inflation rate was just 0.5%, the joint lowest level since records began in 1996.\n\nThe main contribution to the slowdown in the inflation rate has come from prices for gas and electricity. In December 2013 a number of the major utility companies raised their prices. In contrast, there were no increases in December 2014. Meanwhile, the price of petrol and diesel for transport has continued to fall and this has also contributed to the lower rate of inflation.\n##5. Household spending decreased between 2006 and 2013\nUK households spent £517.30 on average per week in 2013. However, when taking inflation into account, average spending has actually decreased since 2006 – when households spent £539.80. The largest single area of spending in 2013 was on housing (excluding mortgages), fuel and power at £74.40 a week.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc230/Finance_Chart5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Interactive chart - UK in a European context\"/>\n##6. Increased spending on household energy, but a decline in fuel poverty\n####Percentage of household disposable income^5^, spent on energy^6^, UK, 2002 to 2012\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc230/Finance_Chart6/Finance_Chart6.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of household disposable income^5^,Â� spent on energy^6^, UK, 2002 to 2012\"/>\n\n[Download the data for this chart.][6]\n\nIn 2012, the poorest fifth of UK households (in terms of disposable income) spent £93 a month on household energy (equivalent to 11% of their disposable income). This is compared with £126 a month for the richest fifth (equivalent to 3% of their disposable income)\n\nSince 2004, domestic energy prices for the UK have generally risen in price by more than the rate of inflation (as measured by the CPI). In 2010 domestic energy prices fell from the previous year’s level for the first time in over a decade. Between 2011 and 2013 domestic energy prices continued to rise above inflation, however these price rises were not sustained in 2014.\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">A household is said to be fuel poor, and therefore experiencing fuel poverty if it needs to spend more than 10% of its income on fuel to maintain an adequate level of warmth (usually defined as 21 degrees for the main living area, and 18 degrees for other occupied rooms). This is referred to as the '10% definition'.</ons-box>\n\nThe number of fuel poor households in the UK in 2012 was estimated at around 4.5 million, representing around 17% of all UK households. This was unchanged from 2011 and 1 million fewer households than in 2009.\n\nOverall there has been a fall in the consumption of both gas and electricity since 2005. This is in part due to rising prices and the impact of energy efficiency policies.\n##7. Total household net wealth has increased overall but there is an unequal distribution across Great Britain\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Total net household wealth is defined as the sum of net property wealth (the difference between the value of owned property and the amount owed on it), physical wealth (assets such as cars, art, antiques etc), net financial wealth (the value of savings and investments minus any debts), and private pension wealth.</ons-box>\n\nTotal net household wealth aggregated across all households in Great Britain in the period July 2010 to June 2012 was £9.5 trillion.\n\n- The largest elements of this were private pension wealth (38%) and net property wealth (37%).\n- 44% of the £9.5 trillion was owned by the wealthiest 10% of households, while only 9% of the £9.5 trillion was owned by the least wealthy 50% of households.\n- This figure has increased from £9.0 trillion in the period July 2008 to June 2010 and £8.4 trillion in the period July 2006 to June 2008 (not adjusting for inflation).\n- Half of all households in the period July 2010 to June 2012 had total net household wealth of £218,400 or more\n\n##Conclusion\nOverall, levels of income have risen since 1980, but the gap between the richest and poorest fifth of households has widened. Nonetheless, the percentage of the household population living in relative low income has fallen, and fewer households are living in fuel poverty.\n\nHowever, there has been a decrease in household spending after inflation is taken into account. This may be related to the growth in pay being below the inflation rate since the economic downturn until very recently when falls in the inflation rate have reversed this situation.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: [better.info@ons.gov.uk][7]\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-perspectives-an-introduction/\n  [2]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Fig-1-RHDI-per-head.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/Fig-2-Equivalised-RHDI-by-richest-poorest-and-median-households.csv\n  [4]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Fig-3-Relative-low-income.csv\n  [5]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Fig-4-Cost-of-living1.csv\n  [6]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Fig-6-Disposable-income-spent-on-household-energy.csv\n  [7]: mailto:better.info@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1. All income figures are deflated using the household final consumption expenditure implied deflator. The poorest fifth of households are those in the bottom quintile of the income distribution and the richest fifth of households are those in the top quintile. The income data for these groups is given as mean income. The data for the average households is the median level of income across all households.\n2. Years are calendar years until 1993 and financial years from then on.\n3. Estimates of regular pay are for Great Britain and exclude bonuses and arrears of pay. The growth rates here are based on three month average figures and are seasonally adjusted. Please note that pay is different from income as income includes any pay together with any income from other sources such as interest on savings. However household income for many households is driven by the pay of household members.\n4. The CPI is the weighted average of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as transport, food and energy. However, housing costs for owner occupiers are intentionally excluded.\n5. Disposable income is the amount of money that households have available for spending and saving after direct taxes (such as income tax and council tax) have been accounted for. \n6. Energy spending here includes spending on electricity, gas and other household fuels such as coal, oil for central heating, paraffin and wood. Transport fuels (e.g. petrol and diesel) are not included."

      "markdown": "With people travelling over 6,500 miles per year^1^ on average, transport is a fundamental part of daily living and, therefore, plays an important role in our economy. The transport industry is a substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter and, over time, has become an increasingly large energy consumer. This inevitably impacts the environment – as illustrated in the [Energy and emissions in the UK][2] article.\n\nThis latest instalment in the [UK Perspectives series][3] presents some key statistics relating to how passenger transport has changed over time in Great Britain. It is important to note there is likely to be sub-national variation within the data, particularly between rural and urban areas. As transport policy in Northern Ireland is fully devolved, transport statistics for [Northern Ireland][4] are recorded separately.\n##1. Distance travelled by car has increased\n####Passenger transport by mode^2^, Great Britain, 1980 to 2013\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc231/Transport_Chart1/Transport_Chart1.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Passenger transport by mode^2^, Great Britain, 1980 to 2013\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][5]\n\nSince 1980, the total distance travelled has increased, predominantly due to increased travel via cars, vans and taxis. Between 1980 and 1990 growth was rapid; this then steadied until 2007, when distance travelled started to level and then fall slightly.\n\nDistance travelled by rail has also risen, particularly in the last 20 years – the distance travelled in 2013 was more than double that in 1980.\n\nCars, vans and taxis’ share of distance travelled has remained fairly stable, and in 2013 were still by far the most used modes of transport – accounting for 83% of all passenger distance travelled in Great Britain. The number of licensed motor vehicles has continued to rise, increasing in every year but one, from 19 million in 1980 to an all-time high of 35 million in 2013^3^.\n\nBuses and coaches accounted for the second largest proportion of all distance travelled in 1980. However, distance travelled by buses and coaches has since declined and from 2001 rail was the mode of transport responsible for the second largest distance travelled in Great Britain.\n##2. Rail accounts for the most distance travelled on public transport\n####Passenger kilometres on public transport, Great Britain, 1985/86 to 2013/14\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc231/Transport_Chart2/Transport_Chart2.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Passenger kilometres on public transport, Great Britain, 1985/86 to 2013/14\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n\nThe largest proportion of distance travelled on public transport in 1985/86 was by bus. However, in 2013/14 rail accounted for 59% of all passenger kilometres, over double that for buses (29%). Passenger distance travelled by both light rail and tram and the underground remained relatively low throughout the period, although they are increasing.\n##3. Buses account for the majority of passenger journeys on public transport\n####Passenger journeys on public transport vehicles, Great Britain, 1985/86 to 2013/14\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc231/Transport_Chart3/Transport_Chart3.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Passenger journeys on public transport vehicles, Great Britain, 1985/86 to 2013/14\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][8]\n\nWhile rail accounts for the most distance travelled by public transport, the highest number of all journeys in Great Britain in 2013/14 were via bus (63%).\n\nThe number of bus journeys in Great Britain outside of London has fallen by more than a third since 1985/86, while the number of bus journeys in London has doubled over the same period. Over half of all bus passenger journeys in England in 2013/14 occurred in London^4^, suggesting bus travel in London is an important driver of overall trends in Great Britain. Both inside and outside of London, bus passenger journeys increased in 2013/14^5^.\n\nPassenger journeys in Great Britain by rail have more than doubled since 1991/92, to 19% in 2013/14. Journeys by light rail and tram, as well as the underground, have also risen in recent years; they were the highest ever in 2013/14, at 0.23 and 1.23 billion journeys respectively.\n##4. Air passenger numbers were almost 4 times greater in 2013 compared to 1980\n####Air traffic: UK airports, 1991 to 2013\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc231/Transport_Chart4/Transport_Chart4.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Air traffic: UK airports, 1991 to 2013\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][11]\n\nSince 1991, the volume of passengers at UK airports has more than doubled – from 95 million to just under 230 million in 2013. The number of commercial aircraft take-offs and landings has also increased, from 1.4 million in 1991 to over 2 million in 2013.\n\nCompared to 58 million passengers in 1980, air passenger numbers in 2013 were almost four times greater, and aircraft take-offs and landings more than double^6^. Following strong historic growth, air traffic fell during the recent economic downturn (2008 and 2009) as well as in 2010, coinciding with volcanic ash and severe winter weather disruption. Passenger numbers increased by 3.5% in 2013, although they remain 5% below the peak of 240 million in 2007. Commercial aircraft movements have remained fairly level since the economic downturn, suggesting the increase in passenger numbers could be due to increasing aircraft size and numbers of passengers per plane.\n\nThere were 72 million passengers at Heathrow airport in 2013, an increase of 2 million from 2012 and accounting for 32% of the total passengers at all UK airports. This was more than twice as many as Gatwick, the second largest UK airport (35 million)^7^.\n##5. Numbers of road accidents and casualties have fallen\n####Reported road accidents, Great Britain, 1980 to 2013\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc231/Transport_Chart5/Transport_Chart5.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Reported road accidents, Great Britain, 1980 to 2013\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][14]\n\nThe number of reported road traffic accidents decreased from 251,000 in 1980 to 139,000 in 2013, a reduction of almost 45%. This is despite the number of licensed motor vehicles having almost doubled since 1980.\n\n- The number of seriously injured casualties has fallen by nearly three quarters since 1980^8^.\n\n\n- The number of fatalities from road accidents has fallen by two thirds, from almost 6,000 in 1980 to under 2,000 in 2013. This is almost 80% lower than the worst peacetime toll of 7,985 road traffic deaths, recorded in 1966.\n\n##6. The number of car occupant injuries in accidents have seen the greatest reduction\n####Killed or seriously injured from road accidents, Great Britain, 1980 to 2013\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc231/Transport_Chart6/Transport_Chart6.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Killed or seriously injured from road accidents, Great Britain, 1980 to 2013\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][16]\n\nThe number of people killed or seriously injured in road accidents is higher in car occupants than any other group of road users. However, the number of car occupants killed or seriously injured has fallen more quickly than the corresponding number of pedestrians, pedal cyclists and motor cyclists. This is partly because of advanced vehicle technology providing improved protection, whereas pedestrians, pedal cyclists and motor cyclists remain more vulnerable.\n\nConsequentially, the numbers of different road users killed or seriously injured are more similar. From 1985, pedestrian deaths or serious injuries became more common than for motorcycle riders or passengers – although this difference is now smaller than it was between the mid 1980s and start of the 2000s. From 2004 to 2012 the number of pedal cyclists killed or seriously injured increased; however, numbers have fallen slightly in the latest 2013 figure.\n##Conclusion\nIn general, people are travelling greater distances – mostly by car. Public transport usage patterns have also changed, with differences between modes used for distance travelled and the number of journeys. Within these patterns, there is also considerable sub-national variation – the related links section has more information.\n\nThe number of road accidents, meanwhile, has fallen considerably since 1980. In addition to the accompanying decline in deaths and serious injuries, this trend would also help to reduce traffic congestion – and the demand for and cost to emergency, health and welfare services.\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/transport-statistics-great-britain-2014\n  [2]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-perspectives-energy-and-emissions\n  [3]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-perspectives-an-introduction/\n  [4]: http://www.drdni.gov.uk/ni_transport_statistics.htm\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/1-Passenger-transport-by-mode.csv\n  [6]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras40-reported-accidents-vehicles-and-casualties\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/2-Passenger-kilometres-on-public-transport.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/3-Passenger-journeys-on-public-transport.csv\n  [9]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/transport-statistics-great-britain-2014\n  [10]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/bus01-local-bus-passenger-journeys\n  [11]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/4-Air-traffic-UK-airports.csv\n  [12]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/avi01-traffic-passenger-numbers-mode-of-travel-to-airport\n  [13]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/avi01-traffic-passenger-numbers-mode-of-travel-to-airport\n  [14]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/5-Reported-road-accidents.csv\n  [15]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras30-reported-casualties-in-road-accidents\n  [16]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/6-Killed-or-seriously-injured-from-road-accidents.csv\n  [17]: mailto:better.info@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

      "markdown": "Climate change and sustainable energy have generated an increasing amount of  media, public and political debate in the UK during recent years.\n\nThis article, part of a [series of UK Perspectives][1] providing an overview of the nation over the last three decades, presents some key statistics relating to national energy and emissions trends.\n##1. Transport is the UK’s biggest energy consumer\n####Energy consumption by final user^1^ (energy supplied basis) for the industry, transport and domestic sectors, UK, 1980 to 2013\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc231/Energy_Chart1/Energy_Chart1.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Energy consumption by final user^1^ (energy supplied basis) for the industry, transport and domestic sectors, UK, 1980 to 2013\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][2]\n\nIn 1988, transport became, and remained, the largest energy consumer. In 2013, it accounted for more than a third (38%) of total energy consumption – compared to a quarter (25%) in 1980.\n\nIn contrast, industry – accounting for the largest share (34%, or over one third) of the UK’s total energy consumption in 1980 – had fallen to 17% by 2013. This is in-line with its reduced UK economic share, combined with industrial processes becoming more energy efficient.\n\nDespite the increase in the number of UK households over time, domestic consumption has remained relatively constant – likely a result of improved energy efficiency. However, since the main driver of domestic energy consumption is heating, year on year fluctuations have generally occurred in accordance with seasonal weather conditions.\n\nTotal UK energy consumption^2^ was highest from 2000 to 2005 at around 160,000 kilotonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe). Of this, industry, transport and domestic consumption totalled almost 140,000 ktoe. The three most recent years of data have shown the lowest level of final energy consumption in the UK since the mid 1980s.\n##2. The UK imports nearly half its energy supply\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Net import dependency is the proportion of the UK’s energy supply that comes from imports. It is calculated by dividing net energy imports (imports minus exports) by the total amount of energy used.</ons-box>\n\n####Energy import dependency, UK, 1980 to 2013\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc231/Energy_Chart2/Energy_Chart2.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Energy import dependency, UK, 1980 to 2013\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][3]\n\nA number of factors determine the amount of energy the UK imports, including energy consumption, production and the price of imports compared to the price of domestic production.\n\nIn 2013, the UK imported more energy than it exported – with its dependency level increasing to 47% owing to an ongoing decline in domestic oil and gas production. This meant nearly half of the UK’s net energy supply came from imports, the highest level since 1974. This was true for all main fuel types, such as coal and gas. However, the UK did remain a net exporter of some products – including petrol.\n\nThe UK’s dependency on energy imports has fluctuated over time. In the early 1980s, the UK became a net exporter of energy after development of oil and gas production in the North Sea. Output fell back in the late 1980s following the [Piper Alpha disaster][4], with the UK temporarily regaining a position as a net exporter in the mid 1990s. However, North Sea production peaked in 1999, and the UK returned to being a net energy importer in 2004 – where it has remained since.\n##3. Coal and gas are the main fuels used for UK electricity generation\n####Electricity supplied^3^ by fuel type, UK, 1980 to 2013\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc231/Energy_Chart3/Energy_Chart3.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Electricity supplied^3^Â� by fuel type, UK, 1980 to 2013\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][5]\n\nCoal and gas have been the main fuels used in the UK’s electricity generation since 1997. Although coal currently generates the largest amount of electricity, proportions have fluctuated over time, largely in-line with prices. Nuclear power has declined since its peak in 1998, corresponding with the closure of a number of nuclear reactors.\n\nRenewable energy, in contrast, has grown steadily since 1980 – with renewable energy sources in 2013 accounting for 15% of total UK electricity generation. Of this, nearly 60% came from wind and solar power.\n##4. The UK’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are decreasing\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The UK has both international and domestic targets for reducing GHG emissions. The 2008 Climate Change Act established the world’s first legally binding emission target of reducing GHG emissions in the UK by at least 80% (from the 1990 baseline) by 2050.</ons-box>\n\nCarbon dioxide is responsible for the largest amount of GHG emissions, accounting for 82% of the total in 2013.\n\n####Emissions of greenhouse gases^4^, UK and crown dependencies^5^, 1990 to 2013\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc231/Energy_Chart4/Energy_Chart4.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Emissions of greenhouse gases^4^, UK and crown dependencies^5^, 1990 to 2013\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n\n- Total UK GHG emissions have dropped by 30% since 1990.\n\n\n- Total UK carbon dioxide emissions have decreased by around 22% since 1990.\n\nA number of factors have contributed to the reductions in emissions, including improvements in energy efficiency, investment in [low carbon technology][8], [carbon budgets][9] and the EU Emissions Trading System ([EU ETS][10]).\n##Conclusion: adapting to change\nThe way the UK sources and consumes energy has changed over time. Currently, more energy is imported than exported, and the transport sector has overtaken industry to become the largest consumer of energy. Meanwhile, coal and gas remain the main fuels used for electricity generation, though renewables are on the rise.\n\nIt is important that the UK is able to adapt to these kinds of ongoing changes and maintain its future energy security for many reasons, including meeting emissions targets and environmental protection – as well as economic prosperity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-perspectives-an-introduction/\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/1-UK-energy-consumption-by-final-user-.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/2-Import-dependency.csv\n  [4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_Alpha\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/3-Electricity-supplied-by-fuel-type.csv\n  [6]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/4-Emissions-of-greenhouse-gases.csv\n  [8]: https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/increasing-the-use-of-low-carbon-technologies/supporting-pages/bioenergy\n  [9]: https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-the-uk-s-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-80-by-2050/supporting-pages/carbon-budgets\n  [10]: https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-the-uk-s-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-80-by-2050/supporting-pages/eu-emissions-trading-system-eu-ets\n  [11]: mailto:better.info@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

      "markdown": "This article presents some key data on the UK economy and UK economic policy from 1980 until the present day, and covers three themes – economic output and trade, inflation and interest rates and public sector finances (deficits and debts).\n\nOther economic aspects have been covered elsewhere in the [UK Perspectives series][1], which presents an overview of the social and economic changes that have occurred in the UK over the last three decades.\n##Economic output and trade\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of the economic output produced by a country. Real GDP is GDP in real or constant price terms; that is, GDP adjusted for price changes.</ons-box>\n###The UK economy has returned to growth\n####Real GDP growth year-on-year, UK, 1980 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc234/Economy_Chart1/Economy_Chart1.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Real GDP growth year-on-year, UK, 1980 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][2]\n\nReal GDP in the UK has typically increased every year, although there have been three downturns in the economy since 1980. After the downturn in the early 1990s, the UK economy experienced sixteen consecutive years of growth before output fell in 2008 and 2009. From 2010, output has been growing again – regaining pre-downturn levels in the third quarter of 2013. Over the period 1980 to 2014, real GDP growth has averaged 2.2% per year.\n\n####Real GDP per head, UK, 1980 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc234/Economy_Chart2/Economy_Chart2.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Real GDP per head, UK, 1980 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][3]\n\nThe rate of growth in UK real GDP has exceeded the rate of growth in UK population since 1980, with UK GDP per head 87% higher in 2014 than in 1980. The impact of the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 can be seen, however, by the fact that GDP per head in 2014 remained below the 2007 level.\n###UK productivity levels remain subdued\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Productivity is one of the most important drivers of economic growth. When productivity increases, more is produced with the same amount of inputs; for example, with the same amount of hours worked. This section focuses on labour productivity defined as output per hour worked.</ons-box>\n\n####Output per hour worked growth year-on-year, UK, 1980 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc234/Economy_Chart3/Economy_Chart3.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Output per hour worked growth year-on-year, UK, 1980 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][4]\n\nLabour productivity grew by an average 1.8% per year during 1980 to 2013. Productivity declined sharply in 2009 during the economic downturn. Growth in productivity was also negative in 2012 and 2013, reflecting that labour market input was rising faster than GDP growth, despite the fact that GDP was once again growing by this time.\n\nThis recent weakness of UK labour productivity relative to its longer term trend has been labelled the ‘productivity puzzle'.\n###The UK has run a trade deficit since 1998\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Trade balance equals exports minus imports. A country has a trade surplus if it exports more than it imports (positive trade balance). A trade deficit occurs if a country imports more than it exports (negative trade balance).</ons-box>\n\n####Imports, exports and trade balance, UK, 1980 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc234/Economy_Chart4/Economy_Chart4.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Imports, exports and trade balance, UK, 1980 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][5]\n\nInternational trade can benefit consumers and producers, providing them with a wider range of goods and services and with more export opportunities. In the UK, both imports and exports have been growing over time, but imports have been higher than exports since the late 1990s – meaning the UK has been running a trade deficit. The last time the UK ran a trade surplus was in 1997.\n\nThe UK balance of trade can be looked at in more detail by breaking it down into goods and services. The UK tends to run a deficit on its trade in goods (imports of goods exceed exports of goods), but a surplus on its services (exports of services exceed imports of services) balance of trade.\n##Inflation and interest rates\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The Bank of England is responsible for price stability in the UK. The inflation rate measures the rate at which the average prices of goods and services change, and the Bank of England’s goal is to maintain this rate close to a target that ensures price stability. This target is 2%. Inflation more than 1 percentage point above or below this target requires the Governor of the Bank of England to write an open letter to the Chancellor. To measure the inflation rate the Bank uses the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). The CPI is calculated using the prices of a specific ‘shopping basket’ of items that’s representative of consumer spending patterns on items such as energy, food and clothing.</ons-box>\n###The inflation rate currently stands at 0.1%\n####Inflation rate, January 1989 to May 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc234/Economy_Chart5/Economy_Chart5.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Inflation rate, January 1989 to May 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][6]\n\nIn May 2015, the inflation rate rose to 0.1% from -0.1% in the previous month. An annual fall in prices is often referred to as \"negative inflation\" or \"deflation\". Based on comparable historic estimates, the last time the UK saw consumer price deflation prior to April 2015 was in the year to March 1960, when prices fell by an estimated 0.6%. The inflation rate has exceeded 3% during five periods since 2003; the highest rate observed being 5.2% in September 2008 and September 2011.\n###Interest rates are also at record low levels\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The Bank of England is responsible for maintaining price stability (controlling inflation) – it does so primarily by setting the ‘base’ interest rate.</ons-box>\n\n####Bank of England interest rates, 1st January 1980 to 6th July 2015^1^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc234/Economy_Chart6/Economy_Chart6.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Bank of England interest rates, 1st January 1980 to 6th July 2015^1^\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n\nThe primary method that the Bank of England uses to maintain price stability is the interest rate at which it lends to financial institutions. This rate affects the rates set by other financial institutions, including lending rates offered to businesses and individuals.\n\nThe official bank rate has been 0.5% since March 2009, which is very low compared to historic trends. A low interest rate can have a positive impact on the economy, because it reduces the cost of borrowing and makes savings less attractive – so people invest and consume more.\n##Public sector finances (deficits and debts)\n<ons-box align=\"full\">If government spending is higher than income, it’s operating what is known as a budget deficit. Public Sector Net Borrowing excluding public sector banks (PSNB ex) is the most widely accepted measure of the overall government budget deficit (or surplus).</ons-box>\n###The UK deficit has been typically positive since 1980\n####UK government deficit, financial year ending 1981 to financial year ending 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc234/Economy_Chart7/Economy_Chart7.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK government deficit, financial year ending 1981 to financial year ending 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][8]\n\nGovernment expenditure has been larger than government income for most years since 1980, which is why the UK deficit has been typically positive since 1980.\n\nIn the financial year ending 2009, the deficit rose sharply following the global financial shock, peaking the following financial year at £153 billion. Government spending for the latest full financial year ending 2014 was £97.3 billion higher than government receipts.\n###UK government debt as a percentage of GDP is rising\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The level of government debt indicates how much the government owes in total. It's an accumulation of each year’s budget deficit, and the government must pay interest payments on this debt. The rate of interest is determined by different factors, including the credibility of the government to pay back and service its debt and market interest rates. Interest rates on UK government debt are currently very low.</ons-box>\n\n####UK government debt as a percentage of GDP, financial year ending 1980 to financial year ending 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc234/Economy_Chart8/Economy_Chart8.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK government debt as a percentage of GDP, financial year ending 1980 to financial year ending 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][9]\n\nThe government has operated a budget deficit most financial years since the financial year ending 1981. As a consequence, the total level of debt has also risen in almost every year since that time. In the financial year ending 2008, prior to the economic downturn, the level of debt was £558bn. By the financial year ending 2014, it had risen to £1402bn.\n\nThe level of debt is often expressed as a percentage of GDP. Debt ranged between 24.2% and 45.6% of GDP over the period financial year ending 1981 to financial year ending 2008. In the financial year ending 2014, it reached 79.1% of GDP.\n\n####Interest payments on public sector debt as a percentage of government expenditure, UK, financial year ending 1981 to financial year ending 2014 ^2^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc234/Economy_Chart9/Economy_Chart9.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Interest payments on public sector debt as a percentage of government expenditure, UK,Â� financial year ending 1981 to financial year ending 2014Â� ^2^\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][10]\n\nThe size of the government debt affects the size of government interest repayments. As with other types of debt, the cost of interest repayments is affected both by the size of the debt and also by the interest rate. Relatively low interest rates explain why debt interest payments as a share of government expenditure since financial year ending 2009 have remained below the share seen in the mid to late 1990s, despite the high levels of the overall debt.\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-perspectives-an-introduction/\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/Economy_Chart1.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/Economy_Chart2.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/Economy_Chart3.csv\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/Economy_Chart4.csv\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/Economy_Chart5.csv\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/Economy_Chart6.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/UKP-Economy-Fig-7-deficit.csv\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/UKP-Economy-Fig-8-debt.csv\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/UKP-Economy-Fig-9-debt-interest.csv\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

This is as high as it has been since comparable records began in 1971, although it previously reached the same level in December 2004 to February 2005. The latest rate is higher than it was prior to the 2008/2009 economic downturn.\n\nThe employment rate decreased during the three economic downturns of the early 1980s, early 1990s and late 2000s. This decrease was more pronounced in the early 1980s, when the employment rate fell to a low of 65.6% in March to May 1983. The lowest value recorded since the start of the 2008/2009 economic downturn was 70.1% from July to September 2011 to September to November 2011.\n##2. Employment rates have risen for people aged 25 and over \n####Employment rates for people aged 25 and over ^2^, UK, 1992 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc234/Labour_Chart2/Labour_Chart2.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Employment rates for people aged 25 and over ^2^, UK, 1992 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][3]\n\nLooking at employment rates for all age groups 25 and over, the data show higher employment rates in 2014 compared with 1992. In particular, there has been a large increase in employment rates for both the 25 to 34 and the 50 to 64 age groups over the past two decades, while employment rates have also increased for those aged 65 and over.\n\nThe recent increase in employment rates for the 50 to 64 age group is partly due to the increase in the state pension age for women (from 60 to 65) being introduced gradually since 2010. However, the employment rate for this age group also rose between 1992 and 2010, prior to these changes.\n##... but not for those aged 16 to 24\nIn contrast to the older age groups, for young people aged 16 to 24 employment rates were lower in 2014 than in 1992. However, this is partly due to fewer young people seeking work due to increasing participation in full-time education. For example, the share of those aged 16 to 17 in full-time education rose from 62.6% in 1992 to 87.6% in 2014 ^3^ .\n\n####Employment rates for people aged 16 to 24 not in full-time education, UK, 1992 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc234/Labour_Chart3/Labour_Chart3.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Employment rates for people aged 16 to 24 not in full-time education, UK, 1992 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][5]\n\nTherefore, in the chart above, employment rates for these age groups are shown only for those young people not in full-time education. The data show that for the 18 to 24 age group, employment rates are at similar level to the early 1990s while for the 16 to 17 age group, the employment rate has fallen.\n##3. The gap in the employment rate of men and women has narrowed\n####Employment rates for men and women aged 16 to 64, UK, 1980 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc234/Labour_Chart4/Labour_Chart4.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Employment rates for men and women aged 16 to 64, UK, 1980 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][6]\n\nHistorically the employment rate for men has been higher than the employment rate for women but this gap has narrowed considerably since 1980.\n\nThe employment rate for women has been rising steadily over time. The current rate and level of female employment are the highest since comparable records began in 1971. In October to December 2014, the employment rate for women was 68.5%, up from 56.9% in December to February 1980. In contrast, male employment rates remain below their 1980 level.\n##4. The unemployment rate stands at 5.7%\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The unemployment rate is the proportion of the economically active population who are unemployed. The economically active population is defined as all people aged 16 and over who are either in employment or unemployed. The unemployed are defined as people without a job who have been actively seeking work within the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks, and people waiting to start a new job.</ons-box>\n\n####Unemployment rate for people aged 16 and over, UK, 1980 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc234/Labour_Chart5/Labour_Chart5.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Unemployment rate for people aged 16 and over, UK, 1980 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n\nIn October to December 2014, the unemployment rate for people aged 16 and over was 5.7%, continuing its downward trend since October to December 2011. However, the current rate is still higher than its pre-2008 downturn rate of 5.2% for late 2007/early 2008.\n\nThe highest unemployment peaks observed in the UK correspond to the economic recessions in the early 1980s (11.9% in March to May 1984) and early 1990s (10.7% in December 1992 to February 1993).\n##5. Changes in the share of  unemployed classed as long-term unemployed\n####The long-term unemployed^4^, as a share of all the unemployed aged 16 and over, UK, 1992 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc234/Labour_Chart6/Labour_Chart6.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The long-term unemployed^4^,Â� as a share of all the unemployed aged 16 and over, UK, 1992 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][8]\n\nIn October to December 2014, 34.3% of the total unemployed were classed as “long-term unemployed” (meaning they had been out of work but looking for work for over 12 months). This share peaked in the early 1990s, when, in February to April 1994, 44.7% of the total unemployed were classed as long-term unemployed. The lowest share recorded was 19.4% in June to August 2004 but it has subsequently increased, mainly because of the late 2000s downturn.\n\nThe flatness of the curve in the past couple of years is the result of long term-unemployment falling at around the same pace as overall unemployment.\n##6. The economic inactivity rate of women has fallen\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The economic inactivity is measured as the proportion of people aged 16 to 64 not in work who have not been seeking work within the last four weeks and/or are not available to start work within the next two weeks.</ons-box>\n\n####Economic inactivity rate for people aged 16 to 64, UK, 1980 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc234/Labour_Chart7/Labour_Chart7.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Economic inactivity rate for people aged 16 to 64, UK, 1980 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][9]\n\nThe economic inactivity rate tells us about the share of the population aged 16 to 64 who are not in work and not seeking/available to work. There are many reasons for economic inactivity such as study, looking after the family or home, sickness/disability or not needing to work.\n\nThe overall economic inactivity rate for October to December 2014 was 22.3%, close to the lowest on record (which was 21.7% during periods of 1989 and 1990).\n\nThe economic inactivity rate increased during the three economic downturns between 1980 and 2014. However, the latest increase in the late 2000s was very small; furthermore, there was no rise if we exclude full-time students.\n\nThe reasons for being economically inactive have evolved over the past decade. Factors that have influenced both male and female inactivity rates include an increase in inactivity due to full-time study and a decline in inactivity due to long-term sickness.\n\nOther factors have been more gender specific and these have led to the sharp narrowing of the gap between male and female inactivity rates. Since 2010, the decline in female inactivity rates has been influenced by increases in the state pension age. However, the main reason for the decline in female inactivity rates over the longer period has been a decline in the share of women staying out of work to look after the family or home.\n\n####Shares of men and women aged 16 to 64 who are economically inactive due to looking after the family or home, UK, 1993 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc234/Labour_Chart8/Labour_Chart8.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Shares of men and women aged 16 to 64 who are economically inactive due to looking after the family or home, UK, 1993 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][10]\n\nThe share of women who are economically inactive due to looking after the family or home has gone down from 15.9% in March to May 1993 to 10.1% in October to December 2014. This change has not been compensated by an equivalent increase in the share of men looking after the family or home.\n##Conclusion\nThe most recent economic downturn had less of an effect on overall employment and unemployment rates when compared with the downturns of the early 1980s and 1990s. Meanwhile, a key feature of the labour market since 1980 has been the continued increase in the employment rate and economic activity rate of women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-perspectives-an-introduction/\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/Fig-1-employment-rate.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/Fig-2-employment-rates-for-people-aged-25-and-over.csv\n  [4]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-350752\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/Fig-3-employment-rates-for-people-aged-16-to-24-not-in-full-time-education.csv\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/Fig-4-employment-rates-for-men-and-women.csv\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/Fig-5-unemployment-rate.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/Fig-6-long-term-unemployed.csv\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/Fig-7-economic-inactivity-rate.csv\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/Fig-8-economic-inactivity-due-to-looking-after-family-or-home.csv\n  [11]: mailto:better.info@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

You may have noticed an increase in the number of people you work with that have pensions.\n\nThis is likely because of an initiative called automatic enrolment. The latest data shows workplace pension membership increased from 50% to 59% over the past year. This was particularly noticeable among the young and people earning £200-300 per week.\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">People have workplace pensions to give them more retirement income. Workplace pensions include any pensions that are provided or facilitated by an employer for their employees. In October 2012, the Government introduced automatic enrolment to increase the number of people with workplace pensions. Under automatic enrolment, employers have a duty to enrol all eligible employees into a pension scheme and to make contributions.</ons-box>\n\n####1. Workplace pension membership increased since introduction of automatic enrolment\n\n<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/03/pensions-1.png\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][1]\n\nIn 2012, 47% of employees belonged to a workplace pension scheme. However, 18 months after the introduction of automatic enrolment this rose to 59%.\n\n####2. Young people’s membership of workplace pensions has increased\n\n<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/03/pensions-2.png\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][2]\n\nYounger people are typically less likely to have a pension. Since 2013, the number of 22-29 year olds with a pension has increased from 37% to 53%. This was the largest increase of all age bands. Although only people aged 22 or over are eligible for automatic enrolment, increases were seen across all age groups.\n\n####3. Large increase in workplace pension membership amongst those earning £200-300 per week\n\n<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/03/pensions-3.png\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][3]\n\nThe largest increase in pension membership was among employees earning £200-300, from 24% in 2013 to 43% in 2014. Although only people earning £182 per week or above in 2013/14 were eligible for automatic enrolment, there was an increase across all earning bands.\n\n####4. Workplace pension membership has increased for those who work for large employers\n\n<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/03/pensions-4.png\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][4]\n\nAutomatic Enrolment started with the largest employers, with gradual roll out to all employers by 2018. Unsurprisingly, the largest increase in pension membership was among employees of larger employers. For workplaces with 500-999 employees, pension membership increased from 51% to 76%.\n\n####5. Large increase in workplace pension membership for process, plant and machine operatives\n\n<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/03/pensions-5.png\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][5]\n\nOf all job types, Process, plant and machine operatives had the largest increase in pension membership from 34% in 2013 to 52% in 2014. The next largest increase in pension membership was for Sales and customer service occupations, from 28% in 2013 to 42% in 2014. This is possibly because employees in these occupation types tend to be younger and lower earners, and so were less likely to have had a pension before automatic enrolment.\n\n####6. London saw the largest increase in workplace pension membership\n\n<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/03/pensions-6.png\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][6]\n\nPension membership was not influenced significantly by region in 2014. Membership was highest in Scotland (64%) and lowest in the East (56%), with London seeing the largest increase, from 52% in 2013 to 63% in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/03/Fact-1-data.csv\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/03/Fact-2-data.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/03/Fact-3-data.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/03/Fact-4-data.csv\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/03/Fact-5-data.csv\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/03/Fact-6-data.csv\n  [7]: mailto:pensionsanalysis@ons.gov.uk\n"

We’ve pulled together a range of data to show how the war affected life in the UK, and how the country has changed since then.\n\n\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/HU_041808.jpg\"/>](https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/HU_041808.jpg)\n\n© IWM. Crown Copyright\n##World War II had a big impact on marriage\n####Annual number of marriages and divorces, England and Wales, 1931 to 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc246/mar_div/mar_div.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Annual number of marriages and divorces, England and Wales, 1931 to 2011\"/>[Download the data](https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/marriages_divorces_data.csv)\n\nThe sharp increase in marriages observed around 1940 can be attributed to the start of the Second World War. The number of males aged under 20 and 20 to 24 marrying increased by 77% and 48% respectively between 1938 and 1940. Following this rise, the number of marriages declined during the war period of 1941 to 1943 but began to rise again towards the end of the war.\n\nThe number of divorces generally increased between 1932 and the early 1990s as a result of changes in behaviour and attitudes. The large increase in the late 1940s (following the end of the Second World War) is considered to be because of women’s increased participation in the labour force which meant couples were no longer as financially dependent on each other.\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/EA_065799.jpg\"/>](https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/EA_065799.jpg)\n\n© IWM. Crown Copyright\n##Births peaked after the war and created the generation known as the 'baby boomers'\n####Annual number of births and deaths, England and Wales, 1931 to 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc246/birth_death/birth_death.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Annual number of births and deaths, England and Wales, 1931 to 2011\"/>[Download the data](https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/births_deaths_data.csv)\n\nThe number of live births and the total fertility rate (TFR) fluctuated throughout the twentieth century with a sharp peak soon after the end of World War II, in 1947.  Live births peaked again in 1964 (875,972 births), but since then lower numbers have been recorded. The lowest annual number of births in the twentieth century was 569,259 in 1977. The number of births is dependent on both fertility rates and the size and age structure of the female population.\n\nThe chart shows a relatively small increase in deaths during WW2, this is because ONS doesn't have records for the significant loss of life by the armed forces overseas. The increase was mainly due to rising infant mortality at the time.\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/population-2.png\"/>](https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/population-2.png)\n\n© IWM. Crown Copyright\n##Adoptions rose during and after the war\n####Annual number of adoptions, England and Wales, 1931 to 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc246/adopt/adopt.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Annual number of adoptions, England and Wales, 1931 to 2011\"/>[Download the data](https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/adoptions_data.csv)\n\nAdoptions increased during the war and peaked after the war in 1946. This is likely due to the introduction of the Children Regulations Act in 1943, formalising the process of adoption.\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/D_001442.jpg\"/>](https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/D_001442.jpg)\n\n© IWM. Crown Copyright\n##Life expectancy increased after the war\n####Life expectancy, England and Wales, 1931 to 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc246/life_exp/life_exp.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Life expectancy, England and Wales, 1931 to 2011\"/>[Download the data](https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/life_expectancy_data.csv)\n\nLife expectancy fell in 1940 because of the effect of the war on the civilian population. For instance, many armed forces were conscripted overseas. After the war life expectancy continued to increase partly due to improvements in infant mortality and childhood immunisation.\n\nLife expectancy at birth in 1931 was 57.8 years for males and 61.8 years for females. This has risen to 80.1 years and 83.8 years respectively in 2015. However, female life expectancy has been consistently higher than male life expectancy throughout the period 1931-2015. It is worth noting that 2013, 2014, 2015 are projections.\n"

The decade 2001 to 2011 saw a fall in the number of people identifying as Christian, and an increase in those identifying with minority religious groups and those reporting no religion.\n\n\n\nThere were 4 million fewer Christians in 2011 than 2001\nMore than 33 million people identified as Christian in 2011, and this was 59% of the population at this time. However, the number of people identifying as Christian has declined since 2001, when there were around 37 million Christians, representing 72% of the population.\n\nThe 2nd largest religious group were Muslims. The number of people identifying as Muslim increased from 1.5 million (3%) in 2001 to 2.7 million people (4.8%) in 2011. All other religious groups also saw an increase between 2001 and 2011.\n\nA quarter of the population, more than 14 million people, said they had no religion in 2011. This was an increase of over 6 million people since 2001 when 15% of the population reported no religion.\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/download.png\"/>][1]\n[Download the data.][2]\n\nChristians had the oldest age profile of all religions\nOver 1 in 5 (22%) Christians were aged 65 and over, compared with 16% of the total population. Muslims had the youngest age profile with nearly half (48%) aged under 25 and 88% aged under 50.\n\nOver 9 in 10 (93%) Christians and people with no religion were from a White ethnic background. Muslims were more ethnically diverse, with two-thirds (68%) from an Asian background including Pakistani (38%) and Bangladeshi (15%). The majority of Hindus and Sikhs were also from an Asian background (96% and 87% respectively).\n\nThe highest proportions of Christians were in the north of England\nFewer than half (48.4%) of the population of London were Christian, compared to more than two-thirds in the North East (67.5%) and North West (67.3%). London was the most diverse region with the highest proportions of people identifying as Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist and Hindu.\nAround 8 in 10 people (80.9%) in Knowsley were Christian, and Christianity remained the largest religion in all local authorities except Tower Hamlets, where there were a higher proportion of Muslims (34.5%) than Christians (27.1%). Norwich had the highest proportion of people reporting no religion with 42.5%, closely followed by Brighton and Hove with 42.4%.\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc257/Religion.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"2001 vs 2011 Census - General Health and Limiting Illness\"/>\n\nOther religious identities in the census: nearly 177,000 people identified as Jedi\nThe Census allows people to write in their religious identity if they do not identify with the main categories included on the census form. Analysis of written responses to the ‘other religion’ option revealed that nearly 177,000 people identified as ‘Jedi’ in 2011, although this was less than half the 2001 figure (390,000 people). The other most common written responses included ‘Pagan’ (57,000) and ‘Spiritualist’ (39,000).\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/Religion-Chart.png\"/>][3]\n[Download the data][4]\n\n\n\nVisit the [2011 Census Analysis website][5] for more information on what the 2011 Census told us about England and Wales, or contact [census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk.][6]\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/download.png\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/All-categories-religion-data.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/Religion-Chart.png\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/Census-religion-data-other-categories.csv\n  [5]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/analysis/index.html\n  [6]: mailto:census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1. The England and Wales census asked the same voluntary religion question in 2011 as was asked in 2001. The question (‘What is your religion?’) asks about religious affiliation, that is how we connect or identify with a religion, irrespective of actual practise or belief. There are other aspects of religion such as religious belief, religious practice or belonging which are not covered by our analyses."

This shift will inevitably impact on the labour market, pension provision, and health and social care demand.\n\n\n\n####1 in 6 people are aged 65 or over in England and Wales\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/older_people_and_carelist2-01.png\"/>][1]\n[Download the data.][2]\n\nThis highlights increased survival to older ages. There was also a notable increase in those aged 65 to 70, representing the first of the baby-boomer generation to reach this age.\n\n####Almost 1 in 10 over 65s were divorced\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/older_people_and_carelist2-03.png\"/>][3]\n[Download the data.][4]\n\nRelationships are particularly important for older people as they’re more likely to have lost people close to them and need daily assistance. Marriage remained the most common marital status (57% of those aged 65+), however there has been a near doubling of cohabitation amongst the over 65s (1.6% in 2001 to 2.8% in 2011).\n\n####Older care home population remained stable between 2001 and 2011\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/older_people_and_carelist1-04.png\"/>][5]\n[Download the data.][6]\n\nDespite the ageing population, the proportion of older people in care homes has actually remained stable since 2001, an increase of just 0.3% compared to an overall increase of 11% in the population at this age. This is likely due to improvements to health and life expectancy and also increasing levels of unpaid care which are expected to double over the next 30 years. Unpaid care is associated with poorer health of the carer, so this may impact our health system too.\n\n####1 in 10 people in England and Wales provide unpaid care\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/06/older-people-and-carelist2-04.png\"/>][7]\n[Download the data.][8]\n\nIn 2011, 5.8 million (10.3%) people provided unpaid care in England and Wales, an increase of 600,000 since 2001. Gypsy or Irish Travellers were the most likely to provide 50 hours or more unpaid care per week, corresponding with the relatively poor health status of this ethnic group.\n\n####Women and people aged 50+ are more likely to be carers \n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/older_people_and_carelist2-06.png\"/>][9]\n[Download the data.][10]\n\nThere were also a considerable number of unpaid carers aged between 5 and 17 years (around 178,000 people). Unpaid care by young people may have long-term consequences, particularly on the carer’s health.\n\nVisit the [2011 Census Analysis website][11] for more information on what the 2011 Census told us about England and Wales, or contact [census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk.][12]\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/older_people_and_carelist2-01.png\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/Population-aged-65-1.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/older_people_and_carelist2-03.png\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/Aged-65-and-divorced.csv\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/older_people_and_carelist1-04.png\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/Aged-65-England-and-Wales.csv\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/06/older-people-and-carelist2-04.png\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/Number-of-unpaid-carers-England-and-Wales.csv\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/older_people_and_carelist2-06.png\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/Unpaid-carers-profile-England-and-Wales.csv\n  [11]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/analysis/index.html\n  [12]: mailto:census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk\n"

In 2011, the proportion of owned homes decreased by 5 percentage points, the first fall in a century. As a consequence, home rentals have increased- this was more common among young people. At the same time, 1.1 million household in England and Wales were overcrowded.\n\nStatistics on housing and home-ownership are essential for planning and monitoring of housing provision across the country.\n####Home ownership fell for the first time in a century\n#####Tenure, England and Wales, 1918 to 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc251/Overcrowd3/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Home ownership fell for the first time in a century\"/>[Download the data][1]\n\nThe decade 2001 to 2011 saw substantial changes in longstanding trends in home ownership and renting. In 2011, more than half (64%, 15.0 million) of the 23.4 million households in England and Wales were owner occupied, however this was a decline from 69% in 2001, which was the first fall in a century.\n\nAs a consequence, there has been an increase in the proportion of rented households (31% to 36%), particularly within the private sector; private rentals rose from 12% to 18% of the housing market, whilst social rented households remained stable, falling slightly from 19% to 18%.\n\nRenters were younger and less likely to be employed. Almost 9 in 10 (87%) HRPs aged 16-24 were renting compared with less than a quarter (24%) of those aged 65-74. Meanwhile, only 1% of HRPs who owned their house were unemployed, compared with 7% of HRPs who rented.\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The HRP (Household representative Person) is usually the oldest full-time worker in a household.</ons-box>\n####Over a million households in England and Wales were overcrowded\n#####Tenure by occupancy category, England and Wales, 2011 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc251/Overcrowd1/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Over a million households in England and Wales were overcrowded\"/>[Download the data][2]\n\nWhile the majority of households (69%, 16.1 million) were under-occupied in 2011, almost 1 in 20 (5%, 1.1 million) households were overcrowded^1^.\n\nMore than two-thirds (68%) of all overcrowded households were rented. In fact rented households were nearly four times more likely (8.6% private rented, 8.7% social rented) to be overcrowded than owner-occupied households (2.3%).\n\nThe greatest extent of household overcrowding was seen in London where around 1 in 10 (11%) households were overcrowded. This was more than twice the level seen in the West Midlands, the region with the second highest degree of household overcrowding at 5%. Housing costs are likely to be the main driver of overcrowding in London compared to the rest of England and Wales.\n\nMore locally, the five local authorities with the highest percentage of overcrowded households were urban areas in London. Newham was at the top of the local area ranking, with a quarter (25.2%) of its households overcrowded. By contrast, areas with the lowest proportions of overcrowded households were rural, for example, in North Kestevan in the East Midlands, just 1.1% of households were overcrowded.\n####Nearly half of all overcrowded households had a HRP from a minority ethnic group\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc251/Overcrowd2/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Nearly half of all overcrowded households had a HRP from a minority ethnic group\"/>[Download the data][4]\n\nHousehold overcrowding is most common among younger people who rent in urban areas. This means that minority ethnic groups who are younger and more likely to live in cities, compared to the majority white British population, are more likely to experience household overcrowding.\n\nHouseholds with a HRP in a minority ethnic group accounted for almost half (48%) of all overcrowded households despite making up only 16% of all households.\n\nOvercrowding was most common in households with a Bangladeshi HRP (around 3 in every 10 households with a Bangladeshi HRP).\n\n\n\nVisit the [2011 Census Analysis website][5] for more information on what the 2011 Census told us about England and Wales, or contact [census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk.][6]\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/06/data.csv\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/House_Chart1.csv\n  [3]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/overcrowding-and-under-occupation-in-england-and-wales/rpt-overcrowding-and-under-occupation-in-england-and-wales.html#tab-introduction\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/05/data1.csv\n  [5]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/analysis/index.html\n  [6]: mailto:census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

This was because 56,300 people came to the area from overseas and 12,000 left the area to live elsewhere in the UK, giving a net migration gain of 44,400. Also, 32,700 more people were born than died, between mid-2004 and mid-2014.\n\nEight of the 10 local authorities with the biggest population growth between 2004 and 2014 were in London. The remaining two were Corby in the East Midlands and Slough in the South East. Net migration has also been the main driver of the increases in Islington and Corby.\n\nNatural change (births minus deaths) has been the main driver of population increase over the decade in Newham, Hackney, Slough, Brent and Waltham Forest with net in-migration having a relatively small effect. This is because relatively high numbers of people are moving from countries outside of the UK to live in these areas, but the increase is cancelled out by similarly high numbers of people moving from these areas to other areas in the UK. This phenomenon is known as population churn.\n####Kensington and Chelsea saw the greatest decrease in population size over the last decade, at 5.8%\n#####Local authorities with the highest percentage decrease in population, 2004-2014, England and Wales\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc264/charts/Horizontal_bar_chartbottom/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Kensington and Chelsea saw the greatest decrease in population size over the last decade, at 5.8%\"/>[Download the data][3]\n\nThe population decreased in 16 local authorities over the decade. The greatest loss was seen in Kensington & Chelsea at 5.8%. The main driver of this decrease was net internal migration, a high number of people moving to live elsewhere in the UK. In contrast to all other areas in London, this effect was not offset by international migration as more people moved from Kensington and Chelsea to live outside the UK than moved in from outside the UK.\n\nThe majority of local authorities with a population decrease were in the North of England. The populations of Barrow-in-Furness and Cleveland decreased mainly because of people moving to live elsewhere in the UK. The populations of West Somerset, Sefton and South Tyneside decreased mainly as a result of smaller numbers of people being born than the numbers dying over the decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc264/map/data/data.csv\n  [2]: http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc264/charts/Horizontal_bar_charttop/data_top.csv\n  [3]: http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc264/charts/Horizontal_bar_chartbottom/data_bottom.csv\n  [4]: mailto:pop.info@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

However, there are exceptions to the rate for Austria (0.225%), Germany (0.15%), Sweden and the Netherlands (both 0.10%).\n\n####3. GNI-based resources\nMember States also a standard percentage of their Gross National Income (GNI). It basically counts all income earned by UK residents regardless of where it was earned.

British identity (either on its own or combined with other identities) was the common identity of 16.3 million people (29.1%).\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/06/ethnicity-2.png\"/>][4]\n[Download the data.][5]\n###One in eight foreign born residents identified as White British\n<svg height=\"130\" width=\"100%\">\n<text x=\"0\" y=\"85\" font-size=\"80\" font-family=\"Open Sans\" font-weight=\"bold\">7.5</text>\n<text x=\"0\" y=\"110\" font-size=\"16\" font-family=\"Open Sans\" font-weight=\"bold\">People born outside UK</text>\n<text x=\"0\" y=\"130\" font-size=\"12\" font-family=\"Open Sans\">million</text>\n</svg>\n\nMigration patterns to the UK have been shown to differ across ethnic groups. There can be numerous reasons for this that can include historic and commonwealth ties, legislative changes, personal, economic and cultural issues and circumstances.\n\nData has shown that in 2011, 7.5 million people were born outside of the UK (13% of the population). Of the foreign born population almost half (46%) identified as White with the majority being Other White (28%) and White British (13%), many of whom will have been born to British people living temporarily overseas, often working in the armed forces. One third identified with Asian (33%) and 13% identified with Black/African/Caribbean/Black British.\n\nThe largest ethnic minority group for the foreign born population was Other White (2.1 million people); the majority (71%) arrived in the UK between 2001 and 2011 reflecting the increase in migrants following Central and Eastern European countries joining the European Union in 2004.\n####Highest employment rate among the 'Other White' ethnic group\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/06/ethnicity-3.png\"/>][6]\n[Download the data.][7]\n\nThe Other White ethnic group (77%) had the highest employment rate of all ethnic groups (people aged 16 to 64) and this was the case for both men (82%) and women (72%). This is largely due to economic migrants from the EU since 2001. Gypsy or Irish Traveller men (49%) and women (31%) and Arab men (50%) and women (29%) had the lowest employment rates of all ethnic groups. Tick-boxes for Gypsy and Irish Travellers and Arabs were introduced in the 2011 Census for the first time.\n\nEconomic inactivity rates were higher for women (28%) than for men (18%) overall and reasons for them both varied. For women, the main reason behind economic inactivity was that they are looking after the family or home (31%), while men were most likely to be economically inactive due to being a student (37%).\n\nEconomic inactivity due to being a student was most common among Chinese men (83%) and women (64%). While economic inactivity due to long-term illness or disability was most common among Gypsy or Irish Traveller men. Economic inactivity due to looking after the family or home was most common among Bangladeshi (54%) or Pakistani (52%) women.\n####Around 1 in 10 people were in an inter-ethnic relationship\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/06/ethnicity-5.png\"/>][8]\n\nCensus data allowed insight into diversity by looking at patterns and trends of people living as a couple in an inter-ethnic relationship^3^. In 2011, of those living as part of a couple almost 1 in 10 (9%, 2.3 million people) were in an inter-ethnic relationship.\n\nOf all people who were in inter-ethnic relationships, 4 in 10 were with someone who was White British. The most common being Other White and White British (16%).\n\nPeople identifying with Mixed/Multiple groups were the most likely to be in an inter-ethnic relationship (over 8 in 10 or 195,000 people), and are themselves likely to be the result of inter-ethnic relationships that have emerged in the last 60 years (from post war immigration patterns). These groups have a much younger age profile than some of the other ethnic groups and 80% of the people in this group were born in the UK.[][10]\n\n\n\nVisit the [2011 Census Analysis website][11] for more information on what the 2011 Census told us about England and Wales, or contact [census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk.][12]\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/rpt-ethnicity.html#tab-Measuring-ethnicity-\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/06/ethnicity-7.png\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/06/Chart-1_ethnicity.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/06/ethnicity-2.png\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/06/ethnicity-chart-4.csv\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/06/ethnicity-3.png\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/06/ethnicity-chart-2.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/06/ethnicity-5.png\n  [9]: http://ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/what-does-the-2011-census-tell-us-about-inter-ethnic-relationships/rpt---inter-ethnic-relationships.html#tab-background-notes\n  [10]: #_ftnref1\n  [11]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/analysis/index.html\n  [12]: mailto:census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1. The England and Wales census first asked the ethnic group question in 1991. Since this time the number of tick boxes has grown from 9 to 18.The list of tick-boxes was designed to enable the majority of people to identify themselves in a manageable way. This [link][1] provides further information about how ethnicity was measured in the 2011 Census. There are some comparability issues with comparing ethnicity over time, further details can be found in the comparability report.\n2. National identity was asked for the first time on the 2011 Census and is a subjective self-identifying measure which may or may not relate to a person’s ethnic group or country of birth. The question (‘How would you describe your national identity?’) allows respondents to express which country/nation they feel most affiliated to. National identity is multi-dimensional, so the 2011 Census question allows respondents to tick more than one national identity.\n3. Inter-ethnic relationships are defined as a relationship between a couple who are either married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting and each partner identifies with an ethnic group different from the other (within any of the [18 ethnic group classifications][9])."

Our general health is important to our sense of wellbeing and quality of life. But is it also an important indicator of whether we will need future medical or social care, or how long we will be able to work.\n##Very good health highest in London\n####Health and activity limitation by Local Authority, England and Wales, 2001 and 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc256/chart1/HealthSA.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Health and activity limitation by Local Authority, England and Wales, 2001 and 2011\"/>\nSource: [2011 Census Analysis, ONS][1]\n[Download the data][2]\n\nAround four-fifths (81.2%, 45.5 million) of the population were in good or very good general health in 2011. The proportion was higher in England (81.4%) than it was in Wales (77.8%).\n\nPeople living in London reported better general health than any other region in England and Wales; more than half (50.5%) rated their health as very good. This is likely due to the younger age structure of the London population compared to other regions of England or Wales. By contrast, people in the North East tended to report the poorest general health with only 44% rating their health as very good and 7.4% rating their health as bad or very bad.\n##Gypsy or Irish Travellers were in the poorest health\n####People in \"Not Good\" health by ethnicity, England and Wales, 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc256/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Gypsy or Irish Travellers were in the poorest health\"/>[Download the data.][3]\n\nAcross different ethnic groups, there was a  [mixed picture of general health][4] that may reflect different age structures, different social conditions or cultural expectations. The poorest health was reported by Gypsy or Irish Travellers, with close to a third (29.8%) in ‘Not Good’ health. In contrast, only around 1 in 12 (8.4%) Black Africans reported ‘Not Good’ health.\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">For these analyses, people in ‘Not Good’ health refer to those who rated their general health as either fair, bad or very bad, whilst ‘Good’ health refers to people who rated their general health as either very good or good.</ons-box>\n\n##People in routine occupations more than twice as likely to report ‘Not Good’ health\n####People in \"Not Good\" health by sex and selected socio-economic class, England and Wales, 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc256/chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"People in routine occupations more than twice as likely to report ‘Not Good’ health\"/>[Download the data.][5]\n\nPoorer general health was associated with [worse socio-economic outcomes][6]. People working in routine occupations^1^ were more than twice as likely to report ‘Not Good’ health than people working in higher managerial and professional occupations^2^ for both males (30.5% compared with 13.7%) and females (33.8% compared with 14.1%).\n##People living in overcrowded houses were in worse health\n####People in \"Not Good\" health by age group and overcrowded household type, England and Wales, 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc256/chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"People living in overcrowded houses were in worse health\"/>[Download the data.][7]\n\nLooking at different age groups, young people, aged less than 16, in overcrowded households were more than twice as likely as their counterparts in under-occupied households to report ‘Not Good’ health (4.0% compared with 1.6% respectively). For those aged 65 and over, 62.0% of those living in overcrowded households reported ‘Not Good’ health, compared with 42.5% in under-occupied households^3^.\n\nPeople living in more deprived areas^4^ reported poorer health than people living in areas with less deprivation. Strikingly, men aged 80 to 84 living in the least deprived areas had better rates of health than men 20 years younger in the most deprived areas.\n\nThe difference in health between the most and least deprived areas is present across all age groups but becomes particularly notable from age 30-34. By ages 60-64 for men and 55-59 for women, there was a 36% gap in the percentages of ‘Not Good’ health across areas.\n##How long do people live in ‘Good’ health?\n####Healthy life expectancy by NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and sex, England, 2010-12\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc256/chart6/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Healthy life expectancy by NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and sex, England, 2010-12\"/>\nSource: [2011 Census Analysis, ONS][8]\n[Download the data.][9]\n\nHealthy life expectancy (HLE) indicates how long a person can expect to live in ‘Good’ health. Males born in England and Wales in 2011 could, on average, expect to live for slightly more than 79 years and spend 63.5 of those years in ‘Good’ health. Females born in England and Wales in 2011, however, could expect to live longer to an average age of 83 years, spending almost 65 of those years in ‘Good’ health.\n\nThis means that although females born in 2011 were estimated to have a longer life and more life years in ‘Good’ health, males could expect to spend a greater proportion of their lives in ‘Good’ health (80.2% compared with 78.0% for females).\n\nThere was a clear North-South divide in health expectancies. People living in areas in the South of England had HLEs above the national average, while the lowest HLEs were in areas with greater.\n\n\n\nVisit the [2011 Census Analysis website][10] for more information on what the 2011 Census told us about England and Wales, or contact [census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk.][11]\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/local-authority-variations-in-self-assessed-general-health-for-males-and-females--england-and-wales-2011/sty-general-health.html\n  [2]: http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/ks301ew\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/health_data2.csv\n  [4]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/ethnic-variations-in-general-health-and-unpaid-care-provision/rpt-ethnic-variations-in-general-health-and-unpaid-care-provision.html\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/health_data3.csv\n  [6]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/health-gaps-by-socio-economic-position-of-occupations-in-england--wales--english-regions-and-local-authorities--2011/rpt-health-gaps-2011.html\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/health_data4.csv\n  [8]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/healthy-life-expectancy-at-birth-and-at-age-65--clinical-commissioning-groups--ccgs--2010-12/index.html\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/health_data6.csv\n  [10]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/analysis/index.html\n  [11]: mailto:census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

Examples of jobs include lawyers, architects and medical doctors.\n3. People who were living alone were excluded from this analysis, as a house cannot be overcrowded with only one person living in it. As a large proportion of those living alone are aged 65 or over, excluding them from this analysis also helps control for the ill-health effects of old age.\n4.

      "markdown": "At its simplest, the UK economy, like any other, is a system which converts work into the output of goods and services. Productivity measures this rate of conversion.\n\nHistorically, productivity has trended upwards over time: more goods and services have been produced per hour worked. This has allowed living standards to rise.\n\n##What has happened to productivity since the economic downturn?\n\n####Productivity, UK, January to March 1997 to January to March 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc270/Prod1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Productivity, UK, January to March 1997 to January to March 2015\"/>[Download the data][1]\n\nEconomies are subject to cyclical fluctuations – booms and busts. It is not unusual for productivity to fall during downturns, as happened in 2008-09. What is unusual is the flat-lining of productivity since 2010. This is unprecedented in the post-war era and has come to be referred to as the “productivity puzzle”.\n\nIf the pre-2007 trend had continued, productivity would now be 16% higher than it actually is. Wages and living standards would also be higher.\n\nThe productivity puzzle is not unique to the UK. Other countries, especially in Europe, have also experienced unusually weak productivity growth during the recent period.\n\n##Output, hours and productivity compared\n\n####Productivity compared with GDP, Employment and Total hours worked, UK, January to March 2008 to January to March 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc270/Prod2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Productivity compared with GDP, Employment and Total hours worked, UK, January to March 2008 to January to March 2015\"/>[Download the data][2]\n\nOutput of goods and services across the whole economy – usually measured by gross domestic product (GDP) - has resumed an upward trend after falling steeply during the economic downturn of 2008-2009. Whereas following earlier downturns this was reflected in rising productivity, this time it has shown up in more hours worked, which have been rising strongly. This has been good for the number of jobs, but not so much for living standards.\n\nMany economists have tried to explain the productivity puzzle but a full explanation remains elusive. Among the many reasons suggested are low levels of investment, the impact of the financial crisis on bank’s willingness to lend to new businesses, higher numbers of people working beyond normal retirement age as a result of population and pensions changes, and firms’ ability to retain staff because of low pay growth. While these and other factors may be relevant, they do not provide a complete explanation for the weakness in productivity.\n\n##How does UK productivity compare with other countries?\n\n####Difference from UK productivity level, G7 countries, 2013\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc270/chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Difference from UK productivity level, G7 countries, 2013\"/>[Download the data][3]\n\nThe level of productivity is higher in the UK than in Japan, but lower than in other major developed economies including the US, Germany and France. The shortfall in the level of UK productivity has persisted for many years, and is often attributed to relatively low levels of investment in the UK.\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/data11.csv\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/data21.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/data3.csv\n  [4]: mailto:digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk\n"

This information helps local authorities to target, deliver and facilitate the provision of public services, for example, to help identify the need for translation and the interpretation for providing English language lessons.\n\n##Nearly a million people could not speak English well or at all\n\n####People who 'can't speak English well' or 'not at all' by local authority, 2011, England and Wales\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc259/Chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"People who 'can't speak English well' or 'not at all' by local authority, 2011, England and Wales\"/>Source: [2011 Census Analysis][1], ONS\n\n[Download the data.][2]\n\nAcross England and Wales, fewer than 1 in 50 people (aged 3 or over) could not speak English well or at all (2%, 863,000). For the majority of local authorities, the inability to speak English well or at all affected less than 1% of the population. However in areas of London, notably Newham, Brent and Tower Hamlets and also in Leicester, between 8 and 9% of the population could not speak English well or at all.\n\n##Poor English language skills linked to worse health and lower employment rates\n####Proficiency in English by health, 2011, England and Wales\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc259/Chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proficiency in English by health, 2011, England and Wales\"/>\n   \n[Download the data.][3]\n\nOnly two-thirds (65%) of people who could not speak English well or at all (‘non-proficient)’ were in good health, compared with nearly 9 in 10 (88%) who could speak English very well or well (‘proficient)’. This may be due to lower proficiency in English making it difficult for people to access suitable healthcare, which may have a longer term impact on health. There was also a more rapid decline of good health by age among people who were less proficient in English.\n\nIn terms of employment, fewer than half (48%) of those ‘non-proficient’ in English were employed, compared with 72% of all usual residents aged 16 to 64. This was particularly evident for females, where around a third (34%) of those ‘non-proficient’ in English were in employment compared with 58% of women who were proficient in English.\n\nIn 2011, 562, 000 people in Wales were able to speak Welsh. \n\n50 million (92%) of people aged three and over reported English (English or Welsh in Wales) as their main language. There were over half a million people in Wales able to speak Welsh (19%, 562,000), and 15% were able to speak, read and write Welsh^2^.\n\n##Polish was the most common main language other than English^3^\n\n####Top 10 main languages other than English (English or Welsh in Wales), England and Wales, 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc259/Chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Top 10 main languages other than English (English or Welsh in Wales), England and Wales, 2011\"/>[Download the data.][4]\n\nAround 1 in 13 people (8%, 4.2 million) in England and Wales had a main language other than English (English or Welsh in Wales). The 2011 Census classified 88 main languages other than English (English or Welsh in Wales). Amongst these, the most prevalent was Polish, which was the main language of 1% of the population (546,000 people), and this was followed by Panjabi (273,000 speakers) and Urdu (269,000). European languages such as French (147,000), Portuguese (133,000) and Spanish (120,000) were also in the top ten.\n\nThere were high proportions of other languages in some local authorities: Tower Hamlets in London where 18% of the population spoke Bengali as their main language or Leicester where 11% of the population spoke Gujarati as their main language.\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/language-in-england-and-wales-2011/rpt---language-in-england-and-wales--2011.html\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/Lang11.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/Lang2.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/Lang3.csv\n  [5]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/analysis/index.html\n  [6]: mailto:census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1. The language question captured information through a tick-box on those who reported their main language as English (or English or Welsh in Wales). A write-in option captured languages other than English, this included Sign Languages. Those that selected the option for another language were asked a follow-up question on proficiency of English spoken. Respondents were asked how well they could speak English and could select one of the four tick boxes, ‘How well can you speak English?’ ‘very well’, ‘well’, ‘not well’, and ‘not at all’.\n2. 'A question on Welsh language skills was also asked on the 2011 Census form in Wales. The question asked was 'Can you understand, speak, read or write Welsh?' - answered by ticking one or more of five boxes (one for each category and one for 'None of these') in any combination.\n3.

But how does this compare to the previous 100 years, and what important events have influenced trends?\n\nThe total number of live births in England and Wales decreased by 0.5% between 2013 and 2014. Across the twentieth century the number of live births have fluctuated, with sharp peaks at the end of World Wars 1 and 2. Live births peaked at near post-war levels again in 1964 (875,972 births), but since then lower numbers have been seen. The lowest recorded annual number of births in the twentieth century was 569,259 in 1977.\n##Live births in England and Wales decreased by 0.5% between 2013 and 2014\n####Annual number of births and deaths, England and Wales, 1915 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc267footnote/figure1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Annual number of births and deaths, England and Wales, 1915 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data][1]\n\nThe highest number of deaths over the century was recorded in 1918 at the end of World War 1, 1918 also saw the outbreak of the Spanish Flu pandemic. The chart shows a relatively small increase in deaths during World Wars 1 and 2, this is because the ONS doesn’t have records for the significant loss of life by the armed forces overseas. The increase during World War 2 was mainly due to rising infant mortality at the time.\n##Mum’s the word\nThe demographic characteristics of mothers have shown interesting changes over the last few decades. In 2014, there were 507,587 live births to UK born mothers compared to 187,610 to non-UK born mothers. Births to non-UK mothers accounted for 27% of all live births in 2014. This is the highest proportion of births to mothers born outside the UK since information on parents’ country of birth was first collected at birth registration in 1969.\n\nThe number of births to women born outside the UK has risen every year since 1995, with a marked rise since the turn of the century. Previous analysis using 2013 data shows that the European Union (EU), excluding the UK, represented 8.7% of all live births. Births to mothers born in one of the 13 countries that have joined the EU since April 2004 represented the majority of these births (6.1% of all live births). Mothers born in the Middle East and Asia contributed 9.5% of all live births while mothers born in Africa contributed 5.2%.^1^\n##27% of all live births in 2014 were to non-UK born mothers\n####Live births to non-UK born mothers^2^ and average age of mothers England and Wales, 1975 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc267/figure2/dual%20panel%20line/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Live births to non-UK born mothers^2^ and average age of mothers England and Wales, 1975 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data][2]\n\nThe average age of mothers is now 30.2 years. This increase in average age of mothers may be due to a number of factors such as increased participation in higher education^3^, increased female participation in the labour force, the increasing importance of a career, the rising opportunity costs of childbearing, labour market uncertainty, housing factors and instability of partnerships.\n##Almost half of all babies (47.5%) were born outside marriage/civil partnership in 2014\n####Live births outside marriage/civil partnership, England and Wales, 1945 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc267/figure4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Live births outside marriage/civil partnership, England and Wales, 1945 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3]\n\nIn 2014 almost half of all babies were born outside marriage/civil partnership, compared with 42.2% in 2004 and only 8.8% in 1974. This continues the long-term rise in the percentage of births outside marriage/civil partnership, which is consistent with increases in the number of couples cohabiting rather than entering into marriage or civil partnership.\n##Infant mortality has fallen from 9.4 to 3.9 per 1,000 live births over the last three decades\n####Infant mortality rates, England and Wales, 1985 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc267/figure5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Infant mortality rates, England and Wales, 1985 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data][4]\n\nInfant^4^ mortality rates have continued to fall in England and Wales over the past 30 years, but the rates of change varied over the period. The change in the first half of the period was more than twice that in the second half. General improvements in healthcare and more specific improvements in midwifery and neonatal intensive care can partly explain the overall fall in the rate of change^5^. In 2014, the infant mortality rate was 3.9 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with 4.0 in 2013. This compares with an infant mortality rate of 9.4 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1985.\n\n\n\n[1]: http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc267/figure1/births%20and%20deaths.csv\n[2]: http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc267/figure2/dual%20panel%20line/Average_age_births_to_non-UK_born.csv\n[3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc267/figure4/livebirthsoutsidemarriage.csv\n[4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc267/figure5/Infant_mortality.csv\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

      "markdown": "The number of people diagnosed with cancer in England every year has more than doubled in the past 40 years^1^.This is in part because the population has increased since the 1970s, particularly among the elderly. The cancer incidence rate has increased by 53%, when taking into account the changing age structure and increase in England’s population. The increase in the number of new cases has placed an increasing demand on cancer services.\n\nNHS England is about to launch a national 5-year action plan for cancer services. This article explores cancer trends over the past 40 years, looking at what the numbers tell us about improvements in diagnosis and survival^2^.\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc273/chart1a/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Cancer cases and survival rates\"/>\n\n[Download the data][2]\n\n###Five-year survival from cancer is improving\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc273/chart1b/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Five-year survival from cancer is improving\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3]\n\nResearch undertaken by the Cancer Survival Group at the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine][4] shows that 5-year survival (for those aged 15 to 99) in England rose substantially over the 40-year period 1971 to 2011. About 30% of patients diagnosed during 1971-72 survived at least 5 years (after accounting for other causes of death) compared with 54% of patients diagnosed in 2010-11^3^.\n\n###The most common cancers for males and females account for over half of all cancers\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc273/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The most common cancers for males and females account for over half of all cancers\"/>\n\n[Download the data][5]\n\nIn 2013, the most common cancer (for all ages combined) among males was prostate cancer (40,372 cases) and breast cancer for females (44,540 cases). The second and third most common cancers were the same for both sexes - lung cancer and colorectal (also known as bowel) cancer.\n\n###Prostate cancer: a sharp increase since the 1990s\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc273/chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Prostate cancer: a sharp increase since the 1990s\"/>\n\n[Download the data][6]\n\nThe incidence of prostate cancer has more than doubled since the 1970s, even after changes in the age structure of the population are taken into account. In the early 1990s, the incidence rate saw a sharp increase, which has been attributed mainly to a rapid increase in the use of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test from around 1990.\n\n[PSA testing][7] is widely used, but it is not part of a national screening programme such as those for cancers of the breast, cervix and bowel. 5-year survival from prostate cancer has increased rapidly, from 37% (for adults diagnosed during 1971-72) to 85% (predicted for males diagnosed during 2010-11).\n##Breast cancer: mortality has fallen substantially\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc273/chart5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Breast cancer: mortality has fallen substantially\"/>\n\n[Download the data][8]\n\nOver the 40 year period, female breast cancer mortality has decreased whilst breast cancer incidence has increased. 5-year breast cancer survival has increased from 53% (for females diagnosed in 1971-72) to 87% (predicted for those diagnosed in 2010-11). There are many factors to consider when asking why breast cancer survival has increased but improvement is likely due to earlier detection through breast cancer screening and advances in treatment.\n##Lung cancer: risen for females and fallen for males\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc273/chart6/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Lung cancer: risen for females and fallen for males\"/>\n\n[Download the data][9]\n\nThe lung cancer incidence rate has increased for females and decreased for males over the last 40 years. 5-year survival is low for those diagnosed with lung cancer, at 8% for males and at 12% for females (predicted for adults diagnosed in 2010-11).\n\nThe narrowing gap in lung cancer incidence rates between males and females has been linked to the changes in smoking habits between the two sexes. Males have historically smoked more than females. After the Second World War, however, females started to smoke in great numbers, whereas the number of male smokers reduced considerably.\n###Colorectal cancer has increased more among males than females\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc273/chart7/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Colorectal cancer has increased more among males than females\"/>\n\n[Download the data][10]\n\nColorectal cancer incidence rates have increased in England since the mid 1970s. The increase has been greater for males than for females. Over the same 40 year period the number of people who have died from colorectal cancer has fallen. In 2006 the national colorectal screening programme was introduced for those aged 60 to 69.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/international-standard-classifications/icd-10-for-mortality/comparing-trend-data-in-icd-10/changes-for-specific-causes-of-death/injury-and-poisoning.pdf\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/cancer1a.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/cancer1b1.csv\n  [4]: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)61396-9/fulltext\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/cancer2.csv\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/cancer4.csv\n  [7]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16832416/\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/cancer5.csv\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/cancer6.csv\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/cancer7.csv \n\n\n####Footnotes:\n1. Only malignant invasive cancers are included in the analysis, using the International Classification of Disease, Tenth revision (ICD-10) codes C00 to C97 excluding C44. ICD-10 code C61 was used for prostate cancer, C50 for breast cancer and C33 and C34 for lung cancer. From 1995, colorectal cancer ICD-10 codes are usually C18 to C20. However, codes C18 to C21 have been used in the 40 year trend reported here to ensure consistency with pre-1995 data, where equivalent codes for C18 to C20 are not available. It is important to note that over the last 40 years ICD codes have changed which may have had an impact on the incidence and mortality trends. More information on the change to ICD-10 from ICD-9 on mortality can be found in: [“The effect of the introduction of ICD-10 on cancer mortality trends in England and Wales”][1]. \n2. The age-groups used in the age-standardised cancer and mortality rates (from birth onwards) are slightly different to the age-groups used in the survival estimates (15 to 99 years old). Cancer registrations for those aged 0 to 14 accounts for less than 1% of the total number of registrations.\n3. For the ‘all cancer’ 5-year survival estimate an index was designed to be independent of changes in the age distribution of patients with cancer and of changes in the proportion of lethal cancers in each sex. For the cancer specific 5-year survival estimate adjustments were made for changes in the age (and sex) profile of patients with cancer. More information on the methodology can be found in the 40-year trend article authored by the Cancer Survival Group at the London School of Health & Tropical Medicine."

      "markdown": "Families and households shape and define our society. The decade 2001 to 2011 saw significant social change in England and Wales- the number of single (never married) people increased as the population has increased, as did the number of people cohabiting or living alone (many of these may be single). The number of concealed families also increased, perhaps due to the recession in 2008 and increasing house prices.\n\n###Increase in single people since 2001\n\n####Marital status of people aged 16 and over, 2001 and 2011, England and Wales \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc254/chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Marital status of people aged 16 and over, 2001 and 2011, England and Wales\"/>\n\n\n[Download the data.][1]\n\nThe decade 2001 to 2011 was characterised by an increase in proportion of single people and a [ decline in the proportion of people who were married][2]. The proportion of people who were widowed also decreased- this was most likely due to increases in life expectancy, particularly for men.\n\nThe increase in the single population was partly made up of couples who chose to live together without entering into a marriage or civil partnership.\n\nIn 2001, 4.0 million people aged 16+ (9.8%) were living in a cohabiting couple. There have been increases in the cohabiting population across all but the youngest age groups since 2001.\n\nIn 2011, 12% of people were in a cohabiting couple (5.3 million people).\n\nAreas with the highest proportions of single people tended to be those with relatively young populations because of the link between marital status and age. This was particularly notable within London - Islington was the area with the highest proportion of single people at 60%.\n\n###Women aged 85+ most likely to live alone\n####Sex distribution of those living alone by age, 2011, England and Wales\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc254/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Sex distribution of those living alone by age, 2011, England and Wales\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][3]\n\n\nThere has been an increase in the number of people who live alone, from 6.5 million in 2001 to 7.1 million in 2011. Those aged 65 and over who were living alone were mostly women (69%), with the percentage increasing from 63% at ages 65-74 to 76% for those aged 85 and over. This is likely due to the longer life expectancy of women compared with men.\n\nThere were 23.4 million households in England and Wales in 2011, an increase of around 1.7 million (7.9%) since 2001. Over this period the proportion of households with dependent children has remained stable at around 29% (6.8 million).\n\n###Fewer stepfamilies with dependent children than in 2001\n\n####Families with dependent children by family type, 2011, England and Wales\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc254/chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Families with dependent children by family type, 2011, England and Wales\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][4]\n\n\nIn 2011, there were 544,000 stepfamilies with dependent children in England and Wales, representing 8.0% of all families with dependent children. In 2001 9.9% of all families with dependent children were step families (631,000). There was an overall decrease in the proportion of couple families with dependent children, and a corresponding increase in lone parent families.\n\nThe percentage of stepfamilies with dependent children who were married increased by 7.8% between 2001 and 2011.\n##70% increase in concealed families since 2001\n\n####Concealed families by family type, 2011, England and Wales\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc254/chart5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Concealed families by family type, 2011, England and Wales\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][5]\n\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">A concealed family is one living in a multi-family household in addition to the primary family. For example, a young couple living with their parents.</ons-box>\n\nThe number of concealed families, has increased to 289,000 (1.8% of all families) in 2011, up 70% since 2001 when there were 170,000 (1.2%). This increase was likely due to the economic downturn, with many people struggling to afford accommodation. Concealed families are mostly made up of couples with no children (44.3%) or lone parents (36.9%). This kind of information is useful for assessing housing demand.\n\nPossible effects of the economic downturn can also be seen in other household types, not just those including concealed families. The number of young adults living with their parents has increased which in turn has caused an increase in one family households with non-dependent children only. Households of unrelated adults have also increased since 2001, indicating house sharing has become more common.\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/data13.csv\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/how-have-living-arrangements-and-marital-status-in-england-and-wales-changed-since-2001-/STY-living-arrangements-and-marital-status.html\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/data9.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/data10.csv\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/data12.csv\n  [6]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/analysis/index.html\n  [7]: mailto:census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk\n"

      "markdown": "Migration is an important, though often controversial, driver of [population change][1]. The potential cost and benefit of immigration is hard to assess because its impact is often not fully realised for many years. The Census shows that the past decade has seen large-scale migration, with over a 60% increase in the non-UK born population in England & Wales.\n\n##1 in 7 people in England and Wales in 2011 were born outside of the UK\nIn 2011, 7.5 million or 13% of the people residing in England and Wales were born outside of the UK. This is an increase of 2.9 million people since 2001 when 4.6 million (9%) were born abroad. Some of these will be UK citizens because their parents were UK citizens overseas at the time of their birth or because they have been granted UK citizenship since arriving.\n\n##When did the Non-UK born population arrive?\n####Decade of arrival for non-UK born population, England and Wales, 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc253/chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Decade of arrival for non-UK born population, England and Wales, 2011\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][2]\n\nMigration has contributed to just under half of the total population change in England and Wales between 1951 and 2011. Around half of all non-UK born living in England and Wales (3.8 million) arrived during the decade 2001-2011, mostly since 2004 when Poland and a number of other Central and Eastern European countries entered the European Union (EU).\n##Most non-UK born residents were born in India, Poland or Pakistan\n####Country of birth of non-UK born population, England and Wales, 1941 to 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc253/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Country of birth of non-UK born population, England and Wales, 1941 to 2011\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][3]\n\nTen non-UK countries of birth accounted for 45% of the foreign-born population of England and Wales. The three largest groups of non UK-born residents were Indian-born (694,000, or 1.2% of the population), Polish-born (579,000 or 1.0%) and Pakistani-born (482,000 or 0.9%).\n\nThose born in Poland showed a near ten-fold increase between 2001 and 2011, from 58,000 (0.1% of the resident population) to 579,000 (1.0%). This was due to Poland and other central-Eastern European countries joining the EU in May 2004.\n\nFrom 1961 until 2001 Indian-born was the second highest ranking non-UK country of birth and became the largest in 2011.\n##Moves were most common in university towns and large cities\n####Migration in the year prior to the 2011 Census, within local authorities and older resident migration, England and Wales, 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc253/chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Migration in the year prior to the 2011 Census, within local authorities and older resident migration, England and Wales, 2011\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][4]\n\nThe census also allows us to analyse movements within England and Wales, in particular those that took place in the year prior to the census. Some 4 million people moved within the same local authority in the year preceding the 2011 Census. The greatest number of moves was seen in university towns and large cities reflecting changes in term-time address for students, and also relocation for family and employment reasons.\n\nA further 2.8 million people moved to different local authorities within the UK. The highest numbers of moves were made into London local authorities, and the greatest proportions were seen in Islington and Hammersmith and Fulham (both over 11%).\n\n##Older people more likely to move to rural and coastal areas\nIn contrast to the younger population, people aged 65 and over were more likely to move for reasons such as retirement, downsizing, or care requirements. The most popular destinations for older people were rural and coastal areas, especially in the South East and South West.\n\nHowever, they were also less likely overall to move; 3.6% of the population aged 65 and over moved in 2011, compared with 14% of those aged under 65.\n\nVisit the [2011 Census Analysis website][5] for more information on what the 2011 Census told us about England and Wales, or contact [census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk.][6]\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pop-estimate/population-estimates-for-england-and-wales/mid-2002-to-mid-2010-revised--national-/sty-components-of-population-change.html\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/data22.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/data14.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/data15.csv\n  [5]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/analysis/index.html\n  [6]: mailto:census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk\n"

In 1841 most people worked in manufacturing, but by 1881 those working in services overtook manufacturing. From 1961 the gap between services and manufacturing widened at its fastest rate, and by 2011 80% of workers were in the service industry and 10% in manufacturing.\n\nIn 1841, 20% of workers were in agriculture and fishing but this number has declined at every census since. In 2011, less than 1% worked in agriculture and fishing.\n###Self employment and home working highest in rural areas in 2011\n####Percentage of self employed and home workers, England and Wales, 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc255/WaT_chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of self employed and home workers, England and Wales, 2011\"/>\nSource: [2011 Census Analysis, Office for National Statistics][3]\n\n[Download the data][2]\n\nSelf-employment was at its highest level in 40 years at the time of the 2011 Census although there was [significant variation across local authorities][4]. Self-employment accounted for a third (33.2%) of all workers in the Isles of Scilly but less than 1 in 10 (8.7%) workers in Corby.\n\nAs with self-employment, the number of home workers is at its highest level and is most prevalent in West Somerset where more than 1 in 4 (25.7%) people in employment were home workers in 2011. This contrasts with Kingston upon Hull where only around 1 in 20 (5.2%) were home workers.\n####1 in 10 people who were retired in 2001 had returned to work in 2011\nEmployment amongst the older population is an important issue, particularly with regard to ongoing changes to the state pension age. The workforce of people aged 65 and over is large, almost a million people in 2011. For those aged 65 to 74, 1 in 10 people who were retired in 2001 had returned to work in 2011.\n###Over half the working population drove to work but less than 1 in 10 carried a passenger\n####Method of travel to work, England and Wales, 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc255/WaT_chart5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Method of travel to work, England and Wales, 2011\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][5]\n\nIn 2011, more than half of the working population of England and Wales (57.5%, 15.3 million people) usually drove to work in a car or van. For the most part, the drivers were the sole occupants of these vehicles with less than 1 in 10 carrying a commuting passenger.\n\nMethods of travel to work vary depending on factors such as distance, time of day and local infrastructure. There are large differences in methods of travel to work between urban and rural areas. For example, the local authorities with the largest proportions of people using public transport were all in London, with two-thirds of people in Newham and Lambeth commuting by public transport.\n###Capital leads the way with number of people cycling to work doubling since 2001\n####Percentage change from 2001 in the number of people cycling to work, England and Wales, 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc255/WaT_chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage change from 2001 in the number of people cycling to work, England and Wales, 2011\"/>\n\n[Download the data][6]  \n\nThe number of people cycling to work aged 16 to 74 in England and Wales has increased by 14% from 651,000 in 2001 to 741,000 in 2011. However, this still represents only around 1 in 35 (2.8%) of all workers. In London as a whole, the number of people commuting to work by bike doubled from 77,000 to 155,000. However several regions saw fewer people cycling to work. There were also substantial increases in the number of people [cycling to work][7] in many other major cities.\n###Workday population of City of London 56x greater than usual resident population\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/cartoFINAL1.gif\"/>][8]\nSource: [2011 Census Analysis, Office for National Statistics][9]\n\nWhere people work can cause substantial changes in the local population during the working day. For example, the workday population of the City of London is 56 times greater (358,000) than its usually resident population of 6,000. At the other end of the scale, Lewisham saw a 28% fall from 206,000 to 149,000, reflecting the large number of people who commute out of the local area for work.\n\n\n\nVisit the [2011 Census Analysis website][10] for more information on what the 2011 Census told us about England and Wales, or contact <census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk>.\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/Work_Chart1.csv\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/Work-_Chart2.csv\n  [3]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/method-of-travel-to-work-in-england-and-wales/art-method-of-travel-to-work.html\n  [4]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lmac/self-employed-workers-in-the-uk/2014/rep-self-employed-workers-in-the-uk-2014.html#tab-Self-employed-workers-in-the-UK---2014\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/data-copy.csv\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/data3.csv\n  [7]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census-analysis/cycling-to-work/sty-cycling-to-work.html\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/07/cartoFINAL1.gif\n  [9]: http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc128/wrapper.html\n  [10]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/analysis/index.html\n  [11]: mailto:census.customerservices@ons.gov.uk\n"

      "markdown": "The most popular [baby names in 2014][1] were Amelia and Oliver. However, the latest data has shown that more parents appear to be looking to modern culture for inspiration on the naming of their children.\n####1. Stark girls are having the greatest influence on Game of Thrones girls’ names\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-1.png\"/>][2]<br>\nIt seems that more parents want their daughters to take Daenerys’ regal name ‘Khaleesi’ than her birth name. We can see that the Stark girl names, Arya and Sansa, remain strong. Brienne is the newest female addition this year, with 4 girls.\n####2. Lannisters, Greyjoys and Starks battle for popularity among Game of thrones boys’ names\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-2-v2.png\"/>][3]<br>\n[Download the data.][4]<br>\nLike the TV series, the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys are battling it out for popularity among the male Game of Thrones names. We can see the largest peak after the series first aired in 2011, but Theon and Bran track each other in popularity after each book release throughout the noughties.\n####3. The ice princess’ name rises up the rankings of baby girls’ names in 2014\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-3.png\"/>][5]<br>\n[Download the data][6]<br>\nThe Frozen phenomenon has seen Elsa, a traditionally turn of the century name, rise up the rankings of baby girls’ names. Her sister Anna proves less popular, and has actually seen a decrease. Even Kristoff and Olaf made a splash on the charts with 3 and 52 babies’ names respectively. This is the first year Kristoff has appeared in the rankings.\n####4. Pop star names rise to fame shortly after debut and hit albums\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-4.png\"/>][7]<br>\n[Download the data.][8]<br>\nSoon after her debut album release in 2010, Rita Ora’s increasing fame is matched by an increase in baby girls called Rita. Similarly, the name Drake became more popular after his hit album in 2010.\n####5. Harry and Louis the most popular baby names of all One Direction members\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-5.png\"/>][9]<br>\nIt’s clear that Harry has the most popular boys’ baby names from One Direction. Zayn appears to have had an influence on parents’ baby name choices, with almost 8 times as many baby boys called Zayn in 2014 as there were in 2010. Niall and Louis also prove less popular, but perhaps we will see a change next year after the group’s huge world tour.\n####6. Logan increased in popularity after X-Men films released\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-6.png\"/>][10]<br>\n[Download the data.][11]<br>\nSince 2000, Logan (Wolverine) seems to have had the greatest effect on baby names of all the X-Men characters.\n####7. Messi and Ronaldo hit names peak before made World Player of the Year\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-7.png\"/>][12]<br>\n[Download the data.][13]<br>\nRonaldo peaked in 2007, the first time he won the Premier League with Manchester United. Messi peaked at little later in 2009, corresponding with his successful season at Barcelona in 2008.\n\nKey world players may also influence names. After the 2014 FIFA World Cup Neymar and Luis (Suarez) increased in popularity, with 8 and 134 respectively in 2014.\n####8. The Kardashian girls rise to fame appears to have influenced baby girls’ names since reality show became a hit\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-8.png\"/>][14]<br>\n[Download the data.][15]<br>\nWe can see the effect in baby names, with Kourtney, Khloe and Kendall all increasing in number since 2010. However, despite being the most popular character, the name Kim has actually decreased in popularity.\n####9. Increased popularity in classic names could be influenced by Downton Abbey\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/Baby-Names-Downton.jpg\"/>][16]<br>\n[Download the data.][17]<br>\nNames that were popular at the turn of the last century (1904) have increased in popularity since around 2004, and Downton Abbey may be having an effect on this since in first aired in 2010. Edith, Violet and Rose were all in the top 30 names in 1904, and are rising in influence once again in the 21st century.\n####10. Hollywood films and actors inspire baby name choices\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-10.png\"/>][18]<br>\nChanning didn’t appear in the baby names list until 2009, most likely after Channing Tatum’s success in the Step Up and 21 Jump Street franchises. Similarly the name Mila increased after 2010, perhaps due to Mila Kunis’ success in the film Black Swan.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/baby-names--england-and-wales/2014/baby-names-in-england-and-wales--2014.html\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-1.png\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-2-v2.png\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/GOTboys.csv\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-3.png\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/frozen.csv\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-4.png\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/Pop-stars.csv\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-5.png\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-6.png\n  [11]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/Logan.csv\n  [12]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-7.png\n  [13]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/football.csv\n  [14]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-8.png\n  [15]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/kardashians.csv\n  [16]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/Baby-Names-Downton.jpg\n  [17]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/downton.csv\n  [18]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/08/BN-post-image-10.png\n"

Yesterday it was revealed that over the last year net migration (the balance between immigration and emigration) reached its highest ever level of 330,000. Also, it was reported that across the UK 1 in 8 people were born outside the UK.\n\nBut the picture of migration is more complex; migration affects some local areas more than others.

In 2014 there were 5 local authorities where 50% (or more) of the population were born outside of the UK. Those 5 local authorities were all in London: Brent (56% non-UK born), Kensington and Chelsea (55%), Newham (51%), Harrow (51%), and Westminster (50%). All these LA’s are within London, which is the region with the largest proportion of non-UK born residents (36%).\n\nThe map shows that the percentage of the non-UK born population is generally lower outside of London, and the lowest levels tend to be found in rural areas.\n\n####Non-UK born population, Great Britain, 2014\nAnnual Population Survey\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc278/map/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Non-UK born population, Great Britain, 2014 Annual Population Survey\"/>Source: [Population by Country of Birth and Nationality][1], ONS\n\n[Download the data][2]\n\nOverall for the UK as a whole, the proportion of the population born outside of the UK was 13% (8.3 million of 63.7 million).

China’s GDP (Gross Domestic Product) has been growing by around 10% a year between 1993 and 2013, compared with the global average of 2.8%. The GDP of China has increased from $0.44 trillion to $9.24 trillion in 2013.\n\n###China has become the world's second largest economy as a proportion of global GDP\nIts share of global GDP rose from 1.7% to 12.2% between 1993 and 2013. The US is still the world’s largest economy but its share of the global economy has fallen, along with Europe’s. Over this period of growth, it’s important to consider how key is China as a trading partner to the UK today?\n\n####Proportion of world GDP by selected parts of the world, 2004 to 2013\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc281/China1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of world GDP by selected parts of the world, 2004 to 2013\"/>Source: [World Bank][1]\n\n[Download the data][2]\n###China is the UK’s second largest non-EU import partner, just behind America\nThe importance of China to the UK economy as a trading partner has increased consistently since 2004, with both imports and exports increasing. China has become the UK’s second largest non-EU import partner behind America, accounting for 7% of UK imports in 2014 compared with 3.3% in 2004. Trade in goods dominates UK trade with China, which has accounted for over 95% of all UK trade imports from China per year since 2004.\n###Imports from China up £26.3 billion in the past decade\n####Goods and services exports and imports with China, 2004 to 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc281/China2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Goods and services exports and imports with China, 2004 to 2014\"/>Source: [UK Economic Accounts][3] ONS\n\n[Download the data][4]\n\nImports of goods and services from China have grown from £11.3 billion in 2004 to £37.7 billion in 2014. Exports have grown at a slower rate, from £4.0 billion to £18.2 billion, but still accounted for 3.6% of UK exports. Due to imports growing at faster rate than exports, the UK’s trade deficit with China has also grown. Our trade deficit stood at £19.5 billion in 2014, the second highest behind Germany.\n###China is now the UK’s 6th biggest destination for UK goods exports\n####Percentage of UK total goods exports by selected country, 2004 to 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc281/China3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of UK total goods exports by selected country, 2004 to 2014\"/>Source: [The Pink Book, Chapter 9, Part 3: Geographical Breakdown][5], ONS\n[Download the data][6]\n\nChina’s economy has had a notable impact on UK exports and imports over the past 20 years. Our trade is typically heavily dominated by the US and a range of European countries, where the UK has always had strong political and geographical links. However, in the past 20 years China has to become our 6th biggest destination for UK goods exports.\n###2.8% of UK business abroad operated in China\nIn 2012, there were 654 UK owned businesses operating in China. These UK owned businesses employed 148,822 people and had a turnover of £13.4 billion. Of this, £6.0 billion came from manufacturing and £6.7 billion from services, of which £3.9 billion was financial and insurance activities. These businesses account for 2.8% of UK owned enterprises abroad, 1.1% of the turnover, and 3.0% of the employment.\n###UK citizens invested £6 billion in China in 2013\nUK citizens invested £6.0 billion in China in 2013, up from £1.9 billion in 2004. In comparison, Chinese citizens invested significantly less in the UK, £950 million in 2014, up from £119 million in 2004. However, China only account for a small amount on inward (0.1%) and outward (0.6%) investment, compared with Europe and the US. The US and Europe account for 74.4% of the UK’s outward investment and 83.1% of the UK’s inward investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.worldbank.org/\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/09/data.csv\n  [3]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa1-rd/united-kingdom-economic-accounts/q1-2015/index.html\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/09/data3.csv\n  [5]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-321799\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/09/data2.csv\n  [7]: mailto:better.info@ons.gov.uk"

The substances most frequently mentioned alongside heroin on death certificates are alcohol, diazepam, methadone and cocaine.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2012, deaths involving heroin and/or morphine had steadily declined; a fall which coincided with a ‘heroin’ drought’ in the UK, which reduced availability in some areas.\n\nBut by 2014, the picture was very different; global opium poppy cultivation had reached its highest level since the late 1930s, according to the United Nations in its [World Annual Drugs Report 2014][3], published in June 2015.\n###There have been recent rises in purity\nThe recent rise in heroin/morphine deaths also coincides with a fall in the purity-adjusted price of heroin; which dropped from £74.32 per gram in 2011 to £49.55 in 2013 ([United Kingdom Drug Situation][4], 2014).\n\nThere was also an increase in the street-level purity of heroin from 17% in 2012 to 29% in 2013 and 36% by 2014, according to National Crime Agency estimates. This compares with a street level purity of 46% in 2009, before the ‘drought’ period.\n\nThe recent UN World Drug Report said: “Overdoses are associated with higher drug purity”.\n\nBut purity remains one of a multitude of factors which can explain fatal heroin and morphine overdoses.\n###Most deaths involving heroin now occur among 30 to 49 year olds\n\nThis is a shift from the situation back in 1993 where deaths occurred predominantly among those in their twenties.\n\n####Drugs deaths by age, 1993 and 2014 \n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc282/cluster/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Drugs deaths by age, 1993 and 2014Â�\"/>\n[Download the data][5]\n\nThe recent rise in heroin deaths is not confined to just England and Wales. A National Records of Scotland report, published on August 25, revealed a sharp spike in the number of deaths from heroin and morphine.\n\nMore than half of the 613 drug-related deaths in Scotland were attributed to heroin or morphine; with 309 lives lost. The figure is a 39% increase on the number of deaths from the drug in 2012.\n\nThe UN report points out that heroin related deaths in the United States of America increased sharply from 5,925 in 2012 to 8,257 in 2013 – an increase of 39%.\n###Anti-overdose drugs due to become more available\nThe risk of a fatal overdose can also be influenced by the availability of substances used to treat overdose.\n\nIn October 2015, changes to the medicines regulations will make anti-overdose drug naloxone easier to obtain.\n\nCurrently naloxone can only be supplied under prescription, therefore non-medical services (such as hostels) which may experience frequent opiate-related overdoses are not able to legally hold stocks of it to use in an emergency (ACMD report, 2012).\n\nAccording to a survey in England by Release and the National Needle Exchange Forum, one-third of local authorities are currently providing take-home naloxone to people who use drugs, as part of their efforts to prevent overdose deaths.\n\nFollowing recommendations by the World Health Organisation and the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs that take-home naloxone should be made more widely available, Public Health England released an[ Public Health England advice note][6] for local authorities and local partners promoting the wider availability of naloxone to reduce overdose death from heroin and similar drugs (Public Health England, 2015).\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/subnational-health3/deaths-related-to-drug-poisoning/england-and-wales---2014/deaths-related-to-drug-poisoning-in-england-and-wales--2014-registrations.html\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/09/Heroin1.csv\n  [3]: https://www.unodc.org/documents/wdr2015/World_Drug_Report_2015.pdf\n  [4]: http://www.nta.nhs.uk/uploads/uk-focal-point-report-2014.pdf\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/09/Heroin2.csv\n  [6]: http://www.nta.nhs.uk/uploads/take-home-naloxone-for-opioid-overdose-feb-2015.pdf)\n  [7]: mailto:better.info@ons.gov.uk\n"

Thankfully times have changed and so have life expectancies in the 170 years since the first lifetable was constructed[^1^](#notes).\n\nThe information contained in the [Decennial Life Tables][1] release, produced every 10 years, provides a fascinating insight into those changes, spanning three centuries.\n###In 2011 life expectancy at birth is almost double what it was in 1841\n####Life expectancy at birth, England and Wales, 1841 to 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc284/line_chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Life expectancy at birth, England and Wales, 1841 to 2011\"/>\n[Data download][2]\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Life tables calculate the number of years a person is expected to live given that they have already reached a certain age. For example, a girl born in 2011 is expected to reach age 82.8, however someone who was 60 years old already in 2011 was expected to live a further 25.2 years, that is until that are 85.</ons-box>\n\nA newborn boy was expected to live to 40.2 in 1841, compared to 79.0 in 2011, whereas a baby girl was expected to live to 42.2 in 1841 and 82.8 in 2011.\n\nThe low life expectancies of the 19th century can be explained by the higher number of infant deaths. Survival past the first year of life was historically a predominant factor in life expectancies and once a child had reached five years of age, he or she was much more likely to reach a greater age.\n\nWhereas a newborn boy was expected to live to age 40.2 in 1841, a one-year-old boy in that same year had a life expectancy of 46.7 years - 6.6 years higher than a newborn.\n###Historically infant deaths were a major factor in life expectancies\n####Average age expected to reach by current age, males, England and Wales, 1841 to 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc284/line_chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Average age expected to reach by current age, males, England and Wales, 1841 to 2011\"/>\n[Data download][3]\n\nThis graph compares the average age a male is expected to reach according to their current age. It highlights the increase in life expectancy at birth since the 19th century. Although it shows only males, females show a similar pattern.\n\nIn the 1840s around 15% of babies died before their first birthday compared with 0.4% in 2011, demonstrating the vast improvements made in reducing infant mortality.\n\nThe additional life expectancy of a one-year-old compared with a newborn continued to increase from 1841 to 1891; at its peak there was a difference of 8.1 years for boys and 6.8 years for girls.\n\nThis may have been due to the fact that it was not a legal requirement to register births until 1874, so data prior to this may have been less accurate (Births and Deaths Act 1874).\n\nThere has been a steady decline since the early 20th century, because of the improvements in public hygiene, childhood immunisations and the creation of the NHS (1948).\n###Females have consistently had a higher life expectancy than males...but the gap in 2011 is almost twice what it was in 1841\nFemale life expectancy at birth was 3.8 years higher than for men in 2011, compared to 2.0 years in 1841.\n\nThis smaller gap in the mid-19th century was in part due to diseases and high infant mortality that affected men and women indiscriminately.\n\n####Difference in male and female life expectancy at birth, England, 1841 to 2010-12\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc284/line_chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Difference in male and female life expectancy at birth, England, 1841 to 2010-12\"/>[Data download][4]\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries the gap between male and female life expectancies began to slowly widen, peaking at 6.3 in 1971. It has been narrowing since, due to faster improvements in mortality for men than for women.\n\nAs well as men's working conditions being a factor, the widening gap can be explained by the decline in tuberculosis (TB). Deaths from the disease, which had been rife in the 17th and 18th centuries, and affected women more than men, had begun to decline in the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century more women were surviving childbirth and were having fewer children, reducing their risk of dying in labour.\n\nSince the 1970s, men have been catching women up in terms of survival. The decline of the mining industry and the move away from physical labour and manufacturing industries towards the [service sector][5] is a likely cause, along with a reduction in the proportion of men [smoking][6].\n###Life expectancy at older ages continues to increase meaning our pensions need to last longer\n####Life expectancy at age 65, England and Wales, 1841 to 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc284/line_chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Life expectancy at age 65, England and Wales, 1841 to 2011\"/>[Data download][7]\n\nThe life expectancy of a woman aged 65 in 1841 was 11.5 years and reached 20.9 years in 2011. For men of the same age it was 10.9 years in 1841 and 18.3 years in 2011. But how has this affected how long pensions need to last?\n\nIn 1908 when the State Pension was first introduced for those aged 70 and over, a woman of this age was expected to live on average an additional 9.3 years, and a man 8.4 years (1901), meaning pensions needed to last around 9 years. However, compare this to the latest figures and we see how pensions need to last longer. The current state pension age for men is 65 and for women it will reach 65 by November 2018. In 2011 men and women at this age were expected to live for approximately 20 more years, meaning we need to make our pensions last more than twice as long as when they were first introduced.\n\nFind out how long you need to make your pension last using this [interactive tool][8].\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lifetables/decennial-life-tables/english-life-tables--no-17--2010-12/index.html\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/09/life_expectancy_1841-20111.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/09/expected_age_to_reach2.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/09/gap-in_m_f.csv\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/transitionfromamanufacturingtoserviceledlabourmarketoverpast170years/2015-08-06\n  [6]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ghs/opinions-and-lifestyle-survey/adult-smoking-habits-in-great-britain--2013/index.html\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/09/life_exp_age651.csv\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/articles/howlongwillmypensionneedtolast/2015-03-27\n \n\n\n<h3 id=\"notes\">Footnotes:</h3>\n1. Most life tables span more than one year, however for ease of use this article uses the census year as the point of reference for each life table. For example, life table 3 spans from 1838 to 1854 but 1851 is used to plot life expectancy."

      "markdown": "During the last two weeks students have been making their way to university in droves for the start of the academic year. In 2013/14, the total number of first-degree undergraduates at higher education institutions, who classed themselves as resident in the UK was 1.3 million.^1^ \n\nStudents who 'fly the nest' to start higher education account for a sizeable proportion of the moves made in England and Wales. This article uses interactive population pyramids, showing data for internal migration, to highlight the age groups that are dominating moves in local areas England and Wales. The pyramids are also used in case studies to explore areas with particularly interesting migration age structures.\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Internal migration is defined as any move made within the UK that crosses a local authority boundary. Migration figures relate to the year ending in June.</ons-box>\n\nThe three local authorities with the biggest inflows and outflows between 2004 to 2014 were Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. These major cities have large populations, with Birmingham having the largest population of any local authority in England and Wales.\n\n###42,500 moves were made into Birmingham from other local authorities\n####Top 5 inflows and outflows of people by local authority, England and Wales, 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc275/figure1/imagebar/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Top 5 inflows and outflows of people by local authority, England and Wales, 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data][1]\n\n###A quarter of those moving to Manchester from other local authorities were aged 18 to 20\n\nManchester has high levels of in and outflows of internal migrants. The population pyramids show that 25% of moves into Manchester were for those aged between 18 and 20, with a peak at 19, the main age that people leave home to study. The Higher Education Statistics Agency data shows The University of Manchester and The Manchester Metropolitan University are ranked 1st and 2nd in the UK for the highest number of undergraduate students enrolled in 2013/14.^2^\n\nThe peak age for outflows of migrants from Manchester local authority is 22 years, this corresponds with the age at which most students leave university. However, at 3,100 people, the peak for outflows of migrants is around two thirds of the peak for inflows, which is 4,900. Outflows are spread over a wider age range than inflows, possibly reflecting some students staying on in Manchester to work/continue with further study.\n\n###Age structure of internal migrant population, England and Wales, 2014 \n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc275/interactive_pyramids/pyramids/index.html#10/170/170/18/20/false/false/na/0/data_internal\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Age structure of internal migrant population, England and Wales, 2014\"/>\n\nThe population pyramids show Oldham, Tameside and Stockport, three of Manchester's neighbouring local authorities, had high outflows of migrants around ages 18 to 20, peaking around age 19. At the same time, inflows for these local authorities peak at around 22. These flows are likely to demonstrate the large number of moves that relate to the start and finish of university studies. These are events that influence the size of the population in many university towns and their neighbouring areas.\n\nLast year 42,500 moves were made into Birmingham this is equivalent to 3.9% of the resident population. City of London has the largest percentage inflow at 11.2%, three other London Boroughs also make it into the top 5 local authorities with the highest percentage inflows. In 2014, 900 people moved into the City of London, the second smallest inflow of all the local authorities. In terms of population City of London is also the second smallest local authority in England and Wales, so any person moving in will have a bigger impact on the inflow as a proportion of residents than other local authorities. For Cambridge, Wandsworth and Lambeth there is evidence of high population ‘turnover’^3^\n\n###Cambridge, Wandsworth and Lambeth show high levels of population ‘turnover’\n###Local authorities with the highest inflows and outflows as a percentage of the resident population, England and Wales, 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc275/figure2figure3/charts23/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Cambridge, Wandsworth and Lambeth show high levels of population ‘turnover’\"/>\n[Download the data][2]\n\n###Cornwall gained 4,000 people as a result of net internal migration in 2014\n\nCornwall gained the most people in 2014 as a result of internal moves. An estimated 21,000 people moved into Cornwall in 2014, 3,800 more than moved out. Wiltshire, Havering, Wealden and East Devon also gained over 2,000 people each as a result of more people moving in from other local authorities than moved out. Of the London boroughs, 27 out of the 33 local authorities experienced a net outflow of people, with the exceptions being Bexley, Bromley, City of London, Havering, Richmond upon Thames and Sutton.\n\n####Five local authorities with highest and lowest net internal migration, England and Wales, 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc275/figure4figure5/charts45/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Five local authorities with highest and lowest net internal migration, England and Wales, 2014\"/>\n[Download the data][3]\n\nNet internal migration (equal to the sum of inflows minus outflows) and in particular high levels of population ‘turnover’ has an impact on the total population of an area. However, the age structure of those migrating has the biggest impact on local characteristics such as employment and health.\n\n####14% of those moving outwards from East Devon were aged 18 to 20 in 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc275/interactive_pyramids/pyramids/index.html#10/91/91/18/20/false/false/na/0/data_internal\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"14% of those moving outwards from East Devon were aged 18 to 20 in 2014\"/>\n\nEast Devon is another example of a local authority with a high level of net internal migration, 2,000 more people moved in than moved out in 2014. The internal migration flow map^4^ shows East Devon’s significant inflows coming from Exeter and outflows to Exeter and Mid Devon in 2014. The population pyramids show that 78% of in migrants to East Devon from other local authorities are over the age of 21 and there is a large peak in out migrants at ages 18 to 20.\n\nThe age profile of migrants in neighbouring local authority Exeter, is different, 36% of in migrants are aged 18 to 20, with a median age of 22. Migration to East Devon is likely to be for work, family and retirement among other reasons, whereas migration to Exeter is likely to be related to take up of a university place.\n\n###36% of people moving into Exeter were aged between 18 and 20 in 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc275/interactive_pyramids/pyramids/index.html#10/106/106/18/20/false/false/na/0/data_internal\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Age structure of internal migrant population, England and Wales, 2014\"/>\n\n###What about England and Wales as a whole?\n<svg height=\"105\" width=\"100%\">\n<text x=\"0\" y=\"60\" font-size=\"60\" font-family=\"Open Sans\" font-weight=\"bold\">28%</text>\n<text x=\"0\" y=\"85\" font-size=\"14\" font-family=\"Open Sans\">of all moves are made by those aged between 18 and 25</text>\n<text x=\"0\" y=\"105\" font-size=\"12\" font-family=\"Open Sans\">2014</text>\n</svg>\n\nThere were an estimated 2.9 million internal migration moves between local authorities in England and Wales in the year ending June 2014. This is the highest number of moves in any year over the decade to 2014 and represents an increase of 141,000 or 5% on the year ending 2013. With 28% of all moves in 2014 made by people aged between 18 and 25^5^, it is likely that a large number of relocations are associated with students starting and finishing higher education.\n\nOverall, females move more than males, with females accounting for 52% of all local authority moves in England and Wales in 2014. At ages 18 to 25, the imbalance is greater with 57% of local authority moves being made by females. This is likely to be driven by more females than males enrolling in higher education and moving away to do so.^6^ Females accounted for 55% of the total number of first-degree undergraduates at HE institutions, who were resident in the UK in 2013/14.1\n\n###Do you want to find out more?\n####Explore these pyramids to see the age profile of both internal and international migrants in your area.\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc275/interactive_pyramids/pyramids/index.html#10/0/0/null/null/false/false/na/0/data_internal\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Explore these pyramids to see the age profile of both internal and international migrants in your area.\"/>\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: [pop.info@ons.gov.uk][4]\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/10/figure1.csv\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/10/figure21.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/10/figure4.csv\n  [4]: mailto:pop.info@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

The indication is that the north has shown the same pattern of growth as the south, but at a later stage and at a slower rate.\n\nThe northern England regions collectively have grown below the UK average in both the 2009-2014 period (growing at 2.2%) and the 2013-2014 period (growing at 2.7%).\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the southern regions, which collectively have grown by 7.5% during the 2009-2014 period and 3.5% during the 2013-2014 period.\n\nMuch of the growth in the southern regions has been in London (14.2%) during 2009-2014. Growth in the southern regions outside of London is still higher than that seen in the north over this period (4.2%).\n\nAt the local authority (LA) district level, the top five growing LA districts in the south all grew faster than the top five growing LA districts in the north.\n\n###Manufacturing remains a big industry in the north whereas professional services thrive down south\n\nHealth is the top employer both in the north and the south, with retail, education, business administration and support services also in the top five for both regions.\n\n####Rank of employers by industry in the north and south, UK, 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc286/bres3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Rank of employers by industry in the north and south, UK, 2014\"/>[Download the data][2]\n\nHowever, in the north, the 2nd biggest industry was manufacturing (7th biggest in the south), while in the south, the 2nd biggest industry was professional, scientific & technical services (7th biggest in the north). The latter has increased by significantly more in the south than in the north between 2013 and 2014.\n\n###How employee growth in ‘Big 5’ city regions in the north compare with other UK cities\n\nThe ‘Big Five’ northern city regions of Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield and Newcastle, with a combined growth between 2009 and 2014 of 2.1%, is roughly in line with the growth of 2.2% for the combined northern regions as a whole, and only slightly behind the combined growth of 2.3% for all city regions used in this analysis, excluding London.\n\nIn contrast, the growth in the number of employees in London of 14.2%, far exceeds the combined growth of all the other city regions used in this analysis.\n\n####Percentage growth in the number of employees by selected city regions, UK, since 2009 and 2013\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc286/bres4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage growth in the number of employees by selected city regions, UK, since 2009 and 2013\"/>[Download the data][3]\n\nAll city regions used in this analysis that are based in the north have seen an increase in the number of employees since 2009, with Manchester growing the most (2.7%) and Liverpool growing the least (1.4%).\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">In this article, “the north” refers to the established definition of the North West, North East and Yorkshire & the Humber regions.

At the time of the latest survey estimates (April 2014), it was £8.80 in London and £7.65 in the rest of the UK.\n\nIt is due to increase by 40 pence, to £9.55 in London and £8.25 in the rest of the UK, as announced by London Mayor, Boris Johnson, on November 2, 2015.\n\nThe Out of London Living Wage is calculated by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University, while the London Living Wage is calculated by the Greater London Authority.\n\nThis compared with the median hourly wage of £15.82 for London and £11.08 for the rest of the UK , as calculated by the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, 2014 provisional results. (Link to Appendix 1 of main Living Wage article.)\n\n###What is the National Living Wage and how much is it?\n\nPlans to introduce a compulsory minimum wage premium for all staff over 24 years of age were introduced in the July 2015 budget.\n\nFrom April 2016, employers are required to pay the National Living Wage of £7.20 an hour for workers aged 25 and older.\nThe government has instructed the Low Pay Commission that the minimum wage premium for over 24s should reach 60% of median earnings by 2020.\n\nThe compulsory rate (the National Living Wage) is based on median earnings while the voluntary living wage rates are calculated according to the cost of living.\n\n###What is the National Minimum Wage and how much is it?\n\nThe National Minimum Wage is the minimum pay per hour almost all employees are entitled to by law. This depends on a worker’s age and whether or not they are an apprentice.\n\nIt is currently (2015 rate) £6.70 for those 21 and over; £5.30 for 18 to 20 year olds; £3.87 for under 18s and £3.30 for apprentices aged 16 to 18 and those aged 19 or over who are in their first year of training.\n\nThe National Minimum Wage is set by the business secretary each year on the advice of the Low Pay Commission and enforced by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).\n\nFrom April 2016, the National Minimum Wage will still apply for workers aged 24 and under while the National Living Wage will apply for those aged 25 and over.\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">At present it is not possible to present estimates of jobs below the National Living Wage because data for April 2016 will not be available until later that year. At the time of this study, the Living Wage was set at £8.80 for London and £7.65 for the rest of the UK.</ons-box>\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: [earnings@ons.gov.uk][6]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/previousReleases\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/10/data2-1.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/10/Cluster.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/10/data3.csv\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/10/Cluster1.csv\n  [6]: mailto:earnings@ons.gov.uk"

A correction has been made to the tenth paragraph of this article where a percentage has been changed from 11% to 9%. This was due to a small error where 2012 to 2013 data were reported for the proportion of girls spending three or more hours on a social networking website instead of 2011 to 2012 data. We apologise for any inconvenience.\n</ons-box>\n\nChildren who spent more than three hours using social networking websites on a school day were twice as likely to report high or very high scores for mental ill-health.\n\nThe Children’s Well-being 2015 publication, which for the first time includes an analysis of data on children’s mental ill-health, revealed that of those who were online for more than three hours, 27% reported high or very high scores for mental ill-health.\n\nThis is more than double those spending no time on them (12%) or those spending up to three hours on social media (11%).\n\n####Total difficulty score type by time spent using social media on a school day, UK, 2011 to 2012\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc290/social/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Total difficulty score type by time spent using social media on a school day, UK, 2011 to 2012\"/>[Download the data][1]\n\n[The Insights into Children's Mental Health and Wellbeing report][2] is part of ONS’s work on the well-being of children.\n\nIt looks at data from the Strengths and Difficulties questionnaire, designed by Prof Robert Goodman, which screens the behaviour of children aged two to 17.\n\nThe questionnaire measures emotional symptoms, conduct and behavioural problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems and sociable behaviour.\n\nThe first four elements are combined to deliver a Total Difficulties score, which can be used as a predictor of mental ill-health, but it is in no way a clinical diagnosis.\n\nOne in eight children – aged between 10 and 15 – scored high or very high scores.\n\nAnalysis of the 2011 to 2012 Total Difficulties scores of children showed there was a clear association between longer time spent on social websites and a higher score.\n\nAround 7% of children aged 10 to 15 reported spending more than three hours on social websites on a typical school day, with girls more likely to than boys – 9% compared with 5%.\n\nChildren who spent more than three hours on social media on a school day reported significantly higher total difficulties scores (averaging 13.3 out of 40) than those who didn’t use it (10.2) or who spent less time using them (10.5).\n\nAnalysts also looked at other measures contained in the children’s wellbeing framework, in order to assess how they relate to mental ill-health.\n\n###Children who were bullied frequently were four times more likely to score highly or very highly\n\n####Total difficulty score type of children by prevalence of bullying, UK, 2011 to 2012\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc290/bullying/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Total difficulty score type of children by prevalence of bullying, UK, 2011 to 2012\"/>[Download the data][3]\n\nThe frequency of bullying was by far the strongest predictor of high Total Difficulties scores of all the measures used.\n\nResearch published in [Peer Victimisation During Adolescence and its Impact on Depression in Early Adulthood][4]  has shown that children who were bullied at 13 were more likely to have depression at 18.\n\nOther [analysis of academic research][5] on bullying found that children who were bullied were more likely to report an increase in depression and anxiety over time.\n\nThe analysis also found that children with anxiety and depression were more likely to be bullied over time.\nThe Insights into Children’s Mental Health and Well-being report found that the frequency of bullying was by far the strongest predictor of high Total Difficulties scores of all the measures used.\n\nIn 2011 to 2012, around one in eight children reported being bullied more than four times in the preceding six months. Those children had a significantly higher than average Total Difficulties Score (16.2) than those who had never been bullied or had been bullied less frequently (9.8).\n\nThe study also highlighted that those children bullied frequently in the previous six months were more than four times more likely to report high or very high Total Difficulties scores (41%) than those who were bullied less frequently or not at all (9%).\n\n###Children’s Mental Health:\n\nIn March 2015, the government pledged £1.25billion to improve mental health services for children and young people. The Department of Health and NHS England also published Future In Mind, detailing the work of the children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing taskforce, set up to improve mental health services and access to them for children.\n\nMental ill-health can manifest itself differently in children, for example in behavioural problems such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and emotional problems such as depression or anxiety.\n\nChildren’s well-being is an important part of the nation’s well-being but needs to be measured in a different way to adults. The framework for measuring national well-being puts indicators into 10 domains.\nTo measure children’s well-being, seven domains have been adopted as a framework but have been populated with measures that reflect the aspects of children’s lives that are important to them, and have the greatest effect on their well-being.\n\nONS has developed a set of 31 headline measures of children’s well-being across the seven domains, which include both objective and subjective measures.\n\nFor more information, please contact: [nationalwell-being@ons.gov.uk][6]\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/10/social-data.csv\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/children-and-young-people-s-well-being-in-the-uk--october-2015/art-insights-into-children-s-mental-health-and-well-being.html\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/10/bullying-data.csv\n  [4]: http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h2469\n  [5]: http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Prinzie/publication/42371450_Peer_victimization_and_internalizing_problems_in_children_a_meta-analysis_of_longitudinal_studies/links/0a85e5359fdb714ddd000000.pdf\n  [6]: mailto:nationalwell-being@ons.gov.uk\n"

He said our businesses needed to “export more, build more, invest more and manufacture more.”\n###Target would like to see the value of exports double\nThe government also has a target, set out in the March 2012 budget, to double the value of UK exports to £1 trillion a year by 2020. While the ABS data cannot tell us directly about the value of exports it can tell us a bit more about the characteristics of exporting businesses.\n\nIn 2014 around one third (32%) of the exporting businesses were one person enterprises and 71% of them reported a turnover of less than £1 million. These figures indicate many of these businesses were operating on a fairly small scale. The proportion of businesses turning over less than £1 million is also unchanged since 2011 indicating little change in the structure of exporting businesses since the 2010 election.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/abs/annual-business-survey/uk-non-financial-business-economy--2014-provisional-results/index.html\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/business-and-energy/annual-business-survey/quality-and-methods/an-estimate-for-the-number-of-buinesses-exporting-in-great-britain-in-2010.pdf\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/11/data.csv\n  [4]: https://www.conservatives.com/manifesto\n  [5]: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-george-osbornes-budget-2014-speech\n\n\n\n####Footnotes:\n1.

The ABS export and import figures are for Great Britain and exclude Northern Ireland. The ABS data is only available on a consistent basis back to 2011. There was a user requirement for an estimate of the number of businesses that exported in 2010 but as this cannot be produced directly from the ABS we have developed new methodology for producing a 2010 estimate which can be seen in \"[An estimate for the number of businesses exporting in Great Britain in 2010][2]\". These estimates should be treated with caution when comparing against 2011 to 2014 estimates as they are based on different methodology.\n2. See page 19 of the [2015 Conservative manifesto][4].

Overall healthy life expectancy in the borough was 67.6 years for males and 69.1 years for females.\n\nThe London borough of Newham had the lowest level of health inequality within it for men, at 3.8 years, as well as one of the lowest levels of healthy life expectancy overall at 57.9 years.\n\nFor females, Newham had the second lowest level of inequality (3.1 years) and also a low number of years lived in good health (56.8 years).\n\nInequality in health between areas within Newham is less noteworthy than elsewhere, largely because most of the areas within the borough have a similarly low healthy life expectancy.\n\nFor example, among males, out of 21 small areas within Kensington and Chelsea only three had a lower healthy life expectancy than the Newham average of 57.9 years.\n\n####Inequality in healthy life expectancy, 2009 to 2013, by upper tier local authority\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc299/scatterplot/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Inequality in healthy life expectancy, 2009 to 2013, by upper tier local authority\"/>\n[Download the data][1]\n###Wokingham is the local authority with the highest male healthy life expectancy in England\nWokingham, in Berkshire, has the highest healthy life expectancy for men (70.0 years), when local authorities in England are compared in terms of their overall healthy life expectancy.\n\nThe borough has the second highest healthy life expectancy for women (70.8 years) as well as a relatively low level of health inequality, 7.1 years between its most and least deprived areas for both men and women. In this case, it is because most areas have good levels of healthy life expectancy.\n\nIn contrast to the example of Newham, there are many local authorities in England that are characterised by low overall healthy life expectancies alongside large inequalities between the areas within them.\n\nOne example of this is Middlesbrough in the North East. Here the average number of years an individual can expect to live in good health is 58.6 years for males and 60.1 years for females, around 10 to 11 years lower than in Wokingham. The level of inequality between the most and least deprived areas in Middlesbrough is 21.0 years for males and 20.0 for females – only slightly less than in Kensington and Chelsea and around five times larger than in Newham.\n\nThe levels of health inequality, described here, are estimated by relating healthy life expectancy in small areas within each local authority, to the level of deprivation in each area, using a statistical model to derive a summary indicator - known as the Slope Index of Inequality. More information on this measure and changes over time in inequalities nationally is available in our[ full report][2].\n\nIf you want to know the expected level of healthy years in the small area in which you live and the inequality in health that exists across your local authority, put your postcode in our tool below to find out.\n\n####Healthy life expectancy and inequality, 2013, by Middle Super Output Area (MSOA)\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc299map/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Healthy life expectancy and inequality, 2013, by Middle Super Output Area (MSOA)\"/>\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-417115\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/disability-and-health-measurement/health-expectancies-at-birth-by-middle-layer-super-output-areas--england/inequality-in-health-expectancies-using-imd-2015-small-area-deprivation-scores--2009-13/stb-he.html\n"

      "markdown": "Winter is approaching and many people are preparing by getting their boilers serviced, wearing warmer clothing and getting their flu jab.  While colder weather can be a risk to health for older people and those with underlying health conditions, this article shows in recent years, higher levels of excess winter mortality are also related to the virulence of circulating flu strains.\n###The number of excess winter deaths in 2014/15 was the highest of the last 15 years\nExcess winter mortality, the difference between the average number of deaths over the winter and the rest of the year, has decreased significantly since the 1950s. This is thanks to improvements in healthcare, home insulation and the introduction of the influenza vaccination programme. However, after a drop in 2013/14, deaths increased substantially in 2014/15.\n\n####Number of excess winter deaths, England and Wales, 1995/96 to 2014/15\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc294update/figure1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Number of excess winter deaths, England and Wales, 1995/96 to 2014/15\"/>[Download the data][1]\n\nBetween December 2014 and March 2015 there were 44,000 excess winter deaths, 2.5 times higher than the record low of the previous winter, and the highest number since the winter of 1999/2000 when flu levels were very high.\n###Daily deaths peaked on 1 January 2015, 35% higher than the five-year average\nDeaths peaked on 1 January last winter when daily deaths were 35% higher than the five-year average. The first part of 2015 (5 to 11 January) also saw weekly deaths at 15,000, the highest number in any given week since the last two weeks of December 1999 and first two weeks of January 2000, when flu levels were very high.\n\nDaily deaths were above the five-year average on 304 out of 365 days in 2014/15. There were only two days during the winter period where daily deaths fell below the five year average, and on both occasions, the difference was less than fifteen deaths.\n\n####Number of daily deaths and 5-year average daily deaths, England and Wales, August 2014 to July 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc294update/figure2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Number of daily deaths and 5-year average daily deaths, England and Wales, August 2014 to July 2015\"/>[Download the data][2]\n###Temperature was a bigger factor in excess winter deaths back in the 1950s and 1960s\nDespite the rise in excess deaths last winter, recent times have seen excess deaths well below that of the 1950s and 1960s. Over the winter periods between 1950/51 and 1965/66 there were on average 62,000 excess winter deaths, more than twice the average over the winter periods between 1998/99 and 2013/14.\n\n####Average number of excess winter deaths, England and Wales, 1950/51 to 2014/15\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc294update/figure3/vertical_bar_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Average number of excess winter deaths, England and Wales, 1950/51 to 2014/15\"/>[Download the data][3]\n\nLooking at 15-year averages from 1950/51 through to 2013/14, it is clear that excess winter deaths have shown a decreasing trend. However, the number of excess winter deaths in 2014/15 was far higher than the average seen in the previous 15 years.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1965 there was a strong relationship between the average winter temperature and winter deaths. Analysis of data from that era suggested that there were more deaths in colder winters than in recent years.\n\nA large part of this may be explained by home improvements meaning that homes are easier to heat and keep warm now than they were half a century ago leading to more stable indoor temperatures.\n\nIn the 1950s and 60s, the majority of houses did not have central heating, and were instead kept warm by fireplaces and stoves. Today, over 90% of houses have central heating. In 2013, 80% of homes had full double glazing, up from 30% in 1996; and approximately 9.6 million dwellings had cavity wall insulation in 2013, up from less than 3 million in 1996.\n###Respiratory diseases such as flu are a major cause of excess winter deaths\nInfluenza is a respiratory disease caused by a viral infection affecting the lungs and airways, and is associated with potentially life-threatening complications such as bacterial pneumonia. This means although flu itself is not always mentioned on the death certificate, it is a contributing factor in a great deal more.\n\nIn the UK, pneumonia affects 1 in 1,000 adults each year, and was the underlying cause of 19% of all excess winter deaths in 2014/15, but was a contributory factor in many more. The predominant strain of flu in 2014/15 was A(H3N2). There were moderate levels of flu circulating in England and Wales in 2014/15, but excess mortality levels were far greater than the last notable A(H3N2) season in 2008/09.\n\n###Weekly number of deaths and Influenza-Like Illness incidence rate (ILI), England and Wales, 1999/00 to 2014/15\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc294update/figures45/figure4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Weekly number of deaths and Influenza-Like Illness incidence rate (ILI), England and Wales, 1999/00 to 2014/15\"/>\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc294update/figures45/figure5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Weekly number of deaths and Influenza-Like Illness incidence rate (ILI), England and Wales, 1999/00 to 2014/15\"/>\n[Download the data][4]\n\nEarly estimates in the winter 2014/15 flu season suggested the flu vaccine was only effective in around 3 in 100 cases. However, updated estimates by Public Health England showed the effectiveness to be closer to 34%. In previous years the vaccine has been around 50% effective, coinciding with a far lower number of excess winter deaths.\n\nDuring the most recent winter, fewer people went to see their GP about Influenza-like illness than in 2010/11, when there was a sharp peak in late December 2010-early January 2011.\n\nYet mortality in 2014/15 was much higher.\n\nThis could be for a number of reasons. The 2010/11 flu vaccine was estimated at 50% effective, far higher than the 34% effectiveness seen in 2014/15.\n\nIn addition to this, the predominant flu strain in 2010/11 was A(H1N1), whereas in 2014/15 it was A(H3N2).\n\nIn 2014/15 influenza A(H3N2) was particularly virulent in elderly people, an already at-risk group, and resulted in numerous care home outbreaks. By contrast, the 2010/11 flu strain was particularly virulent in younger people and has less of an impact on the elderly.\n\nDespite the lower effectiveness of the flu vaccine in 2014/15, flu jab remains the best way to protect yourself and your family from flu. For more information about the flu vaccine, take a look at the winter 2015/16 flu vaccine [information booklet][5] and [flu plan][6].\n\n\n\nFor more information, please see the full release on [Excess Winter Mortality][7] or contact: <mortality@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc294/figure1/data.csv\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/11/figure2.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/11/figure3.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/11/figure45.csv\n  [5]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/451734/9407_PHE_General_Flu_A5_booklet_06b_web.pdf\n  [6]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/418038/Flu_Plan_Winter_2015_to_2016.pdf\n  [7]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/subnational-health2/excess-winter-mortality-in-england-and-wales/2014-15--provisional--and-2013-14--final-/index.html\n \n"

      "markdown": "The average ([median][1]) weekly pay for full-time employees rose by 1.8% in the latest year, according to the latest figures from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE).\n\nThe data showed a rise from £518 in April 2014 to £528 in April 2015. But how has pay changed over a longer period?\n\nBack in 1997 the average hourly wage for full-time employees was £7.92 compared to £13.36 in 2015, but looking at averages alone can mask bigger changes in the distribution of earnings. Pay is affected by many factors, not least the health of the economy. Several pay initiatives have also been introduced over the last 18 years, including those written into law such as the National Minimum Wage (NMW). This analysis shows that such initiatives appear to have had a profound effect on the distribution of earnings.\n\n####Distribution of gross hourly earnings, 1997 to 2015, UK\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc304/minwage1/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Distribution of gross hourly earnings, 1997 to 2015, UK\"/>[Download the data][2]\n\nIn 1997, the distribution shows that many jobs were paying between £4 and £5 per hour, with the number of jobs being paid more than this gradually decreasing as hourly pay increased. In 2015, by contrast, there is a large spike of jobs being paid around the £6.50 mark – in line with the [NWM rate][3] for those aged over 21 in 2014. Above this level of pay the distribution follows a similar pattern to that of 1997, albeit shifted to right, with larger numbers of jobs at higher hourly wages partly as a result of inflation and higher productivity.\n\nSo it appears that there is a bigger concentration of jobs at the bottom end of the pay scale in 2015 than in 1997, many of them being paid close to the minimum wage.\n\n*Correction - This section was incorrectly described in terms of hours worked paid close to the minimum wage, rather than jobs paid close to the minimum wage [02/12/15 1.30pm]*\n####Proportion of adult jobs worked paid within 2% of the National Minimum Wage, 1999 to 2015, UK\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc304/minwage2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of adult jobs worked paid within 2% of the National Minimum Wage, 1999 to 2015, UK\"/>[Download the data][4]\n\nThe National Minimum Wage was introduced in April 1999 and at the time the adult rate (those aged 22 and above) was set at £3.60 an hour. This has gradually increased over time to £6.70 in October 2015 for those aged 21 and over. During this time a greater proportion of jobs have been paid at or close to this rate. In 1999, around 2% of jobs were paid within 2% of the NMW, and this has steadily increased to over 5% of jobs in 2015.\n\nSo more jobs are being paid close to the minimum wage. One possible reason for this is that earnings growth for employees hasn’t always matched increases to the minimum wage - which have been greater than inflation in most years since its introduction. In 2002, around 70% of full-time employees saw real earnings growth (a measure that is adjusted for inflation). However, following the economic downturn this fell to around 35% in 2011.\n\nIn fact, many full-time employees saw a reduction in their real weekly earnings during this time. By 2015, this trend had reversed again: around 70% of full-time employees experienced real weekly earnings growth in the year to April 2015.\n\n####Percentage of full-time employees by their annual rate of real weekly earnings^1^ growth %, 2002 to 2015, UK\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc304/minwage3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of full-time employees by their annual rate of real weekly earnings^1^ growth %, 2002 to 2015, UK\"/>[Download the data][5]\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/11/data11.csv\n  [3]: http://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/11/data2.csv\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/11/data3.csv\n\n\n\n####Footnotes:\n1.

On average more was spent on second hand cars and vans (£14.60) than new (£9.20). This is because more cars and vans are bought second hand than new.\n\nSpending on transport included £22.90 on motor fuels, broken down into £14.90 per week on petrol and £8.00 on diesel. Spending on air fares averaged £6.10 per week, rail fares £3.60, and bus fares £1.50.\n\nThe increase in spending can partly be attributed to an increase in purchases of new cars. It coincided with the increased rate of economic growth, when households had more disposable income, allowing them to spend more on discretionary items.\n\n###What else have families been spending their money on?\nUse our interactive treemap to delve through the details\n####Household expenditure UK 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc203/treemap_fin.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Household expenditure UK 2014\"/>\n\nAn increase in leisure spending on and culture could be a sign of recovery\nOne type of spending that might be considered to be discretionary is recreation and culture, which saw a 6.8% rise in spending, from £64.40 in 2013 to £68.80 in 2014.

It reveals that highest number of births occur at the end of September.  The interactive graphic shows the average number of births on any given day and the rank from first to 366^th^.\n###How popular do you think your own birthday is?

Part of the reason for this increase in births could be due to couples planning to have children at the start of the school year. ^1^\n\nIf births were evenly distributed throughout the year we would expect on average 1,800 births each day. But the average number of births on September 26 was around 2,000.\n\nEngland and Wales is not the only country to have seen this trend. Similar analysis using data for New Zealand and the [U.S][4] shows a larger number of babies born in September.\n###Babies born over the Christmas holidays\n####Average daily births, England and Wales, 1995 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc307/line_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Average daily births, England and Wales, 1995 to 2014\"/>[Download the data][5]\n\nWhile the Christmas holidays may be a popular time to make a baby there tend to be fewer babies born, with 6 of the 10 least popular dates of birth falling in the Christmas and New Year period.\n\nThis is likely to be due to the large number of bank holidays over the period. Hospitals will generally only be delivering natural births and carrying out emergency caesareans over the holidays. Induced births and elective caesareans are likely to be scheduled on alternative dates.\n\nFebruary 29 has the lowest total number of births over the twenty year period because it only occurs once every 4 years. However, the average number of births on February 29 takes into account the day only occurs on a leap year, resulting in a value just under the overall daily average.\n\nInterestingly April 1 is ranked low, perhaps due to parents electing not to have an April Fool’s Day baby where possible.\n###One born every minute\nOver the past 20 years there were 8 days where 1,440 babies were born. On these days, to coin a phrase there was one born every minute:\n\n- 25 December 2014\n- 6 February 2005\n- 16 May 2004\n- 6 July 2002\n- 9 February 2002\n- 13 April 1998\n- 25 October 1997\n- 11 February 1996\n\nContrary to the saying, over the last two decades,on average a baby has been born every\n<svg height=\"110\" width=\"100%\">\n<text x=\"0\" y=\"100\" font-size=\"110\" font-family=\"Open Sans\" font-weight=\"bold\">48</text>\n</svg>\nseconds.\n\nVisit the [website][6] for more information on births in England and Wales, or contact <vsob@ons.gov.uk>\n\nIf you like our visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up ][8]to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc307/line_chart/data.csv\n  [2]: http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/5736\n  [4]: http://thedailyviz.com/2012/05/12/how-common-is-your-birthday/\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc307/line_chart/data.csv\n  [6]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/birth-summary-tables--england-and-wales/2014/stb-births-in-england-and-wales-2014.html\n  [8]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n\n\n####Footnotes:\n1.

This is because of improvements in healthcare and changes in lifestyle - such as the decline in the number of people who smoke.\n\nIt is also assumed that improvements will continue. This means babies born in 2016 are more likely to make it to 100 than people who were born in 1936 (aged 80 in 2016).\n\nThe chart shows that regardless of current age, women are more likely to reach 100 than men. There has been much speculation about why this is and possible reasons include men historically being more likely to take risks, smoke cigarettes and consume more alcohol than women.^1^ This [BBC article][4] also speculates that it could be linked to the negative effects of testosterone and the positive effects of oestrogen.\n###How many of today's babies will reach 100?\nIn 2016 there are estimated to be 783,000 babies under one year old and the latest projection suggests that 248,400 of these will live to see their 100th birthday, that's one in every three.\n\nHowever, if they plan to party with fellow centenarians in 2116 it’s not likely the celebration will have an equal split of men and women. That’s because baby girls are more likely to reach 100 than baby boys – 134,500 (35.2%) of today’s baby girls are expected to reach 100, compared with 113,900 (28.4%) of today’s baby boys.\n\n###Number of babies estimated to live to 100, UK, 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc221/charts/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Number of babies estimated to live to 100, UK, 2016\"/>[Download the data][5]\n###How likely are you to receive a telegram from the monarch?\nLooking back over the past few decades, we’re sure The Queen will have noticed an increase in the number of celebratory messages she's sent to people turning 100 – the estimated number of centenarians has more than quadrupled from 3,000 in 1983 to 14,500 in 2016.\n\nThe number of centenarians is also projected to continue rising – reaching 83,300 in 2039 - more than enough to keep any future monarch busy!\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/01/data1.csv\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ghs/opinions-and-lifestyle-survey/adult-drinking-habits-in-great-britain--2013/stb-drinking-2013.html#tab-Key-points-in-2013-\n  [3]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ghs/opinions-and-lifestyle-survey/adult-smoking-habits-in-great-britain--2013/stb-opn-smoking-2013.html#tab-The-proportion-of-the-population-who-smoke-cigarettes-has-fallen-over-the-last-40-years\n  [4]: http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151001-why-women-live-longer-than-men\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/01/data2.csv\n\n\n####Footnotes:\n1.

(Sources:  BRES 2014, ONS). Britain's biggest steel producer, the Indian firm Tata, employs 17,000 in the UK, according to press reports.\n\n(BRES, 2015 is due to be published in September 2016.)\n\nThe 1971 census of employment recorded 323,000 steel workers, representing 1.5% of all in employment. By 1981 this had almost halved to 167,000 (0.8%)\n\nThe decline in employment is particularly noticeable between the late 1970s and mid 1980s, with the biggest drop recorded between 1978 and 1981, when employment fell from 271,000 to 167,000.\n\nDuring this time there were national strikes, employment reform and many plant closures such as those in [County Durham][2], [Northampton][3] and [Shotton][4].\n\nThe British Steel Corporation - a nationalised industry until 1988 - had been closing its outdated and loss-making plants to improve productivity amid [losses in the region of £145million.][5]\n\nEmployment in the steel industry fell below 100,000 in the late 1980s and, after that, declined gradually throughout the 1990s and 2000s, reaching 37,000 in 2008.\n\nAfter a dip related to the 2008-2009 economic downturn, steel industry employment recovered slightly to 34,500 in 2014.\n\nMore than 4,000 job closures in the British steel industry have been announced since September 2015, according to reports in the media, including [BBC News][6].\n###Employment in the steel industry by region\nThe distribution of employment in the steel industry across Great Britain is significantly different from that of employment in all industries. Its relative importance, jobs-wise is strongest in Yorkshire and the Humber, in Wales and in the North-East. Together these three regions contained 67% of steel industry employment in 2014 but only 16% of total employment.\n\n####Regional distribution of employment in the steel industry compared with total employment, 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc303/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Regional distributionÂ� of employment in the steel industry compared with total employment, 2014\"/>[Download the data][7]\n###Increasing productivity\nWhile employment has decreased to about one tenth of its 1970s peak, total steel industry output has fallen by only about a half over the same period. This mainly reflects increased productivity, which had broadly increased five-fold during that time.\n\n####Steel production in Great Britain, 1900 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc303/chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Steel production in Great Britain, 1900 to 2015\"/>[Download the data][8]\n\nData provided by the International Steel Statistics Bureau are used directly in the estimation of steel industry output in the ONS's monthly Index of Production. These data (which are not seasonally adjusted) indicated that the UK produced 9.5 million metric tons in 2011, the lowest crude steel production tonnage since the 1930s.\n\nThe output of the steel industry (gross value added) was £2.2bn in 2014 (current prices) (ONS, National Accounts). This represented 0.1% of the figure for all industries. This represents a decline from 1990, when it made up 0.5% of total output (ONS, National Accounts).\n###Export of steel\nAccording to UK Trade, November 2015, the UK exported £6.1 billion of iron and steel in 2014. In the same year the UK imported almost as much iron and steel, though, with £5.9 billion coming in.\n\nIn 2013, the UK exported £6.1 billion in iron and steel and imported £5.3 billion.\n\nFor more information, please contact: <digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk>\n\n####Footnotes\n\n1. The employment figures in this report are for employees plus working owners. They therefore include those self-employed workers who are registered for VAT or Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) schemes. Self-employed people who are not registered for these, along with HM Forces and government-supported trainees are not included.\n\n2. Definition of the steel industry in this analysis.\n\nEmployment within the steel industry can be traced back to 1971 via data from the:\n\nCensus of Employment (1971-1981 (SIC 1968), 1981-1991 (SIC 1980))<br>\nAnnual Employment Survey (1991-1998 (SIC 1992))<br>\nAnnual Business Inquiry (1998-2008 (SIC 2003))<br>\nBusiness Register and Employment Survey (BRES) (2009-2014 (SIC 2007))<br>\n\nWhile employment data are available from 1971, due to changes in the Standard Industrial Classifications (SIC), the definition of the steel industry may slightly change between surveys. Moreover, due to methodological changes between surveys there exists discontinuities. Hence caution should be used when comparing data across years.\n\n#####Definitions used to represent the steel industry:\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:top}\n</style>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n  <tr>\n    <th class=\"tg-031e\">Years</th>\n    <th class=\"tg-031e\">Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)</th>\n    <th class=\"tg-031e\">SIC codes used</th>\n    <th class=\"tg-031e\">SIC descriptions</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">1971-1981</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">SIC 1968</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">311<br>312</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">Iron and Steel (General)<br>Steel tubes</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">1981-1991</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">SIC 1980</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">2210<br>2220<br>2230</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">Iron and steel industry<br>Steel tubes<br>Drawing, Cold Rolling and Cold Forming of Steel</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">1991-1998</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">SIC 1992</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">27.1<br>27.2<br>27.3</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">Manufacture of basic iron and steel and of ferro-alloys<br>Manufacture of tubes<br>\n Other first processing of iron and steel and production of non-ECSC ferro-alloys</td>\n</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">1998-2008</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">SIC 2003</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">27.1<br><br>27.2<br>27.3</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Manufacture of basic iron and steel and of ferro-alloys<br>Manufacture of tubes<br>Other first processing of iron and steel</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">2009-2014</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">SIC 2007</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">24.1<br><br>24.2<br><br>24.3</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Manufacture of basic iron and steel and of ferro-alloys<br>Manufacture of tubes, pipes, hollow profiles and related fittings, of steel<br>Manufacture of other products of first processing of steel</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<br>\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/11/figure12.csv\n  [2]: http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/lifestyle/nostalgia/remember-when-consett-steelworks-1980-7568430\n  [3]: http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/northampton/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8715000/8715706.stm\n  [4]: http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/northeastwales/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8596000/8596684.stm\n  [5]: http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/2/newsid_2478000/2478393.stm\n  [6]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-35339153\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/11/figure21.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/01/figure41.csv\n \n"

Motoring organisation the [RAC][3] predicts that it may fall to as little as 90 pence per litre.\n\nThere is [speculation][4] that oil might drop to as low as $10 a barrel; the last time it sold at this price was in 1998.\n\nBut what’s behind the drop and is the price of fuel likely to go any lower?\n###The price of oil\nThe extent to which retailers can discount the price of fuel is dictated by a number of factors. The supply of new sources of oil and world events can have an effect, but market forces play a dominant role in how much customers pay.\n\nThe cost of Brent Crude, a classification of oil extracted from the North Sea,  is a benchmark that serves as a reference price for buyers and sellers of all types of crude oil.\n\nThe cost of a barrel of crude oil has dropped from $65 in December 2015 to $28 a barrel last Monday (January 18), the lowest price since April 2004.\n\nIn December 2014, the average price of a litre of petrol was £1.20, but by December 2015 it had dropped to £1.04 per litre, according to the[ Consumer Price Index (CPI).][5]\n\nThe cost of diesel has gone from £1.25 per litre to £1.08 in the same period.\n\nWhile this price fluctuation can result in fuel prices being slashed on the forecourts, the recent price drop can be partially attributed to a glut of crude oil on the world market.\n\nSince January 2015, crude oil prices, as measured by the [Producer Price Index][6], have been falling at a much higher rate than those of petrol and diesel. Although prices of petrol and diesel have been dropping since the end of 2013, there has been a much faster decline since last January.\n\n####The annual percentage change in the price of crude oil and fuel\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc309/chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The annual percentage change in the price of crude oil and fuel\"/>[Download the data][7]\n###Supply\nOPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) [announced in December 2015][8] that it would maintain current oil production levels, despite the fall in the cost of a barrel of Brent Crude.\n\nThe protection of its market share in the face of competition from US shale oil and a slowdown in demand was [reportedly][9] behind the decision.\n\nThe low price of oil is thought to be having an impact on the US shale oil industry, which has seen the recent closure of a number of drilling wells.\n\nThe US Energy Information Administration predicted that total domestic shale-oil production will fall by 116,000 barrels a day to 4.9 million a day in January 2016.\n\nFigures from oil-field service firm Baker Hughes,which counts the number of drilling rigs actively exploring or developing oil or natural gas in the US, show that there were 1,872 land rigs in November 2014.\n\n[By January 2016, there were 650.][10]\n\nThere have also been [reports][11] in the media speculating on what the impact the end of Western sanctions against Iran will have on the global market.\n###The cost of a litre of fuel – where the money goes\nThe price of fuel can be divided into three sections the cost of the fuel itself (which is made up of the wholesale price, the cost of distributing the fuel and fuel companies’ profit margins); fuel duty (which is charged at a fixed rate of 57.95 pence per litre); and VAT. VAT is charged at 20% of the wholesale price plus the duty, which equates to 16.7% of the final price.\n\nUnder normal market conditions, only a fraction of the cost of a litre of petrol ends up in the coffers of fuel retailers. For petrol, at its current average price of £1.04 per litre, just over 72% of the price will go to the exchequer in fuel duty and in Value Added Tax (VAT), leaving only around 28% of ‘wriggle room’ for cutting the price to consumers when the price of crude oil falls.\n\n####Petrol prices explained\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc309/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Petrol prices explained\"/>[Download the data][12]\n\nSince fuel duty is charged at a fixed price per litre, the lower the cost of fuel per litre, the smaller percentage of profit for the retailer and supplier. So, if petrol cost 80 pence per litre, duty and VAT would represent 89% of the cost with less than 9 pence (11%) going to the retailer.\n\nEven if fuel were given away for free, someone would still have to foot the cost at the pumps of 70 pence per litre; liable in fuel duty and VAT.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the plunging cost price of oil and the corresponding cut in the price in the pump has impacted our purchasing behaviour: in 2015 the amount of fuel we bought at the pump increased by 7.6% on the previous year, according to the  [Office for National Statistics', Monthly Business Survey (Retail Sales Inquiry)][13].\n\nFor more information, please contact: [ppi@ons.gov.uk][14]\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/01/oil.jpg\n  [2]: http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/22/asda-cuts-diesel-price-97-7-litre\n  [3]: https://www.rac.co.uk/\n  [4]: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/12098469/Oil-price-crash-means-petrol-could-become-cheaper-than-bottled-water.html\n  [5]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/december-2015/index.html\n  [6]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ppi2/producer-price-index/december-2015/index.html\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/01/PPI_Crude_Oil-CPI_Fuels_and_lubricants.csv\n  [8]: http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2ecbbace-70c5-11e5-9b9e-690fdae72044.html#axzz3wSgZ1IIW\n  [9]: http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/716c6f0c-5ad3-11e5-a28b-50226830d644.html#axzz3wSgZ1IIW\n  [10]: http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=79687&p=irol-rigcountsoverview\n  [11]: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/11502772/Iran-nuclear-deal-to-see-20-oil-if-Tehran-floods-crude-market.html\n  [12]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/01/Petrol-prices-explained.csv\n  [13]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rsi/retail-sales/december-2015/index.html\n  [14]: mailto:ppi@ons.gov.uk\n"

This is partly due to the development of, and improvements in chemotherapy treatments. In 1971 there were no effective treatments for leukaemia, unlike solid organ tumours, which could be surgically removed^2^.\n\nThere have also been big improvements in the survival estimates for people diagnosed with multiple myeloma (a cancer of the bone marrow). Some of this increase is likely to be because of earlier diagnosis and better detection, though improvements in estimates since the early 1990s probably reflect more effective treatment options^3^.\n\nSurvival estimates for pancreatic cancer remain low: - the one year survival estimate is up from 11% to 21% but the five year estimate has only risen from 2% to 3% and the 10 year survival estimate has stayed the same, 1%. These low estimates may be explained by the fact pancreatic cancer doesn't usually have many symptoms until the tumour has grown to a significant size. Diagnosis then takes place at a late stage, when the cancer is already likely to have spread to other parts of the body^4^.\n\nFor more information, please contact: [cancer.newport@ons.gov.uk ][5]\n\n###Notes\n\nThe latest one and five year cancer survival estimates are available [here][6]. 10 year survival was not calculated as part of this release.\n\nSurvival estimates for breast cancer are based only on female patients (males can get breast cancer, but more than 99% of patients are female).\n\nSurvival rates for cancer of the larynx (voice box) are based only on male patients (females can get cancer of the larynx, but the vast majority of patients are male).\n\nMultiple myeloma is a cancer than affects the bone marrow.\n\nNon Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease are cancers that affect the lymphatic system (part of the immune system).\n\nMelanoma of the skin is skin cancer\n\nThe analysis does not include non-melanoma skin cancer.

As health problems generally develop with age, it is reasonable to expect that older people are less able to participate in activities as freely as they once were.\n\n###Loneliness and well-being\n\nONS publication, [Insights into Loneliness][5], showed that those aged 80 and over were twice as likely to report feelings of loneliness compared with younger age groups.\n\nWhat’s more, these feelings of loneliness were found to have a strong relationship with low personal well-being ratings.\n\n###Why well-being ratings vary with age\nOur well-being may change as we move through our lives, have new experiences, and possibly change the way we look at things.\n\nThe differences might also be partly explained through socio-economic factors. Middle-aged people (between the ages of 45 and 59) report the lowest average ratings of life satisfaction and happiness and are also likely to be the generation taking on larger responsibilities, such as a career, family, mortgage and perhaps caring for an elderly relative.\n\nAs people age into the 60 to 74 generation, their well-being increases dramatically; a potential factor influencing this could be the transition into retirement and a reduction in expectations on themselves.\n\n\nNew data has also been published this week looking at how personal well-being ratings compare for different areas of the UK. You can find out what personal well-being is like in your area by exploring these interactive maps.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc238/index2.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Well-being map\"/>\n\n####Background notes:\n\n1. The following analysis is based on the Annual Population Survey Personal Well-being Three year dataset. The data covers the period April 2012 to March 2015.\n\n2. Those aged 16 and over living in private households were asked “Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?”, “Overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile?”, “Overall, how happy did you feel yesterday?”, “Overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday?” where 0 is “not at all” and 10 is “completely”.\n\n3. Differences have only been noted in text where they are statistically significant. Statistically significant differences have been assessed through non-overlapping confidence intervals. This method provides a conservative estimate of statistical significance.\n\n4. The results are not the outcome of regression analysis, trying to hold all other characteristics (for example, sex) equal. Results therefore do not tell us how important age matters to well-being ratings compared against other factors.\n\n5.

      "markdown": "Young adults (aged 20 to 34) in the UK are more likely to be sharing a home with their parents than any time since 1996.^1^\n\nThere were 618,000 more young adults living with their parents in 2015 than in 1996 - 3.3 million compared with 2.7 million.\n\nThe UK Government says it wants to increase the accessibility of affordable housing for young people^2^, while other political parties, including the Opposition, have also raised the issue.\n\nAround one in four young adults lived with their parents in 2015.\n\nNearly half of 20 to 24 year olds lived with their parents in 2015, compared with a fifth of 25 to 29 year olds. For 30 to 34 year olds, this figure was less than one in 10.\n\n####Number of young adults aged 20 to 34 living with their parents, UK, 1996 to 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc315/chart1/line_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\"/>[Download the data][2]<br>\n\nSo what could be driving these trends?\n###Decline in home ownership among young adults\nThe percentage of young adult householders^3^ owning their home decreased from 55% in 1996 to 30% in 2015 for 25 to 29 year olds; and from 68% to 46% for 30 to 34 year olds.\n\n####Percentage of 25 to 34 year old householders owning or renting^4^, UK, 1996 to 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc315/chart2/line_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\"/>[Download the data][3]<br>\n\nThe percentage of 25 to 34 year old householders renting their home has surpassed those who own their homes over the last decade. There has been a noticeable increase in renting since the early 2000s. This may be due to increased demand for rented housing as house prices increase and an increased supply of privately rented housing from a growing number of buy-to-let investors.\n\nThe increase in renting has been largest for householders who are aged 20 to 24.\n\nIn 2015, 91% of householders aged 20 to 24 were living in rented accommodation; this is higher than all other age groups.\n\nOnly 9% of 20 to 24 year old householders owned their homes either outright or with a mortgage or loan in 2015, down from 30% in 1996.\n\n####Percentage of 20 to 24 year old householders owning or renting, UK, 1996 to 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc315/chart3/line_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of 20 to 24 year old householders owning or renting, UK, 1996 to 2015\"/>[Download the data][4]<br>\n###Increased deposits needed to buy a home\nSaving for a deposit is often seen as one of the biggest hurdles to home ownership.\n\nFirst time buyers' deposits have increased from around 10% of the purchase price in 1996, to a peak of 27% in 2009. This was the height of the economic downturn, when mortgage lenders placed greater restrictions on the mortgage lending criteria used to assess applicants’ ability to afford a home loan.\n\nIn recent years the size of deposits paid has fallen slightly but remained above 20% of the purchase price on average.\n\nThe size of deposits paid by first time buyers has risen more than deposits paid by existing homeowners. This is because prospective first time buyers who have smaller deposits saved were less likely to be approved for a mortgage, and therefore less likely to buy a home. That left only those with larger deposits who did buy their first home, which in turn pushed up the average deposit paid.\n\n####Deposit as percentage of purchase price, UK, 1996 to 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc315/chart4/line_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Deposit as percentage of purchase price, UK, 1996 to 2014\"/>\n###First time buyers are spending more on houses relative to their income\nBetween 1971 and 1999, the amount paid for a house by first time buyers with a mortgage fluctuated between two and three times their annual income. After 2000, this ratio increased rapidly, driven by increasing house prices, reaching a peak of more than 4.5 times their annual income in 2004 and has remained fairly stable since then.\n\n####Ratio of price paid to income of borrower for first time buyers, UK, 1971 to 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc315/chart5/line_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Ratio of price paid to income of borrower for first time buyers, UK, 1971 to 2014\"/>[Download the data][5]<br>\n\nThis analysis is based on people who have successfully purchased their first home. There are many young adults for whom properties at the bottom end of the market are unaffordable.\n\nIn 2014 median house prices^5^ (all dwellings) were 11 times median gross annual pay for 22 to 29 year olds, while median house prices for first time buyers were nine times median gross annual pay for 22 to 29 year olds.^6^,^7^\n\nWhile house prices have generally risen recently, they have not always been matched with increases in earnings.\n\nIn 2013 the real earnings (adjusted for inflation) of people in their 20s were 12% lower on average than those in their 20s in 2009.^8^ Young adults also have higher rates of unemployment.^9^\n###First time buyer numbers on the rise again\nNumber of mortgage loans for first time buyers, UK, 1980 to 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc315/chart6/line_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"First time buyer numbers on the rise again\"/>\n\nBetween 1980 and 2002, there were on average 486,000^10^ mortgages issued to first time buyers per year, although this fluctuated over the time period. After 2002 the number of mortgage loans to first time buyers dropped substantially. Since 2012 there has been some recovery but the level still remains below the average seen prior to 2003.\n###Men more likely than women to live with their parents\nMen aged 20 to 34 were more likely to be living with their parents than women.\n\n60% of 20 to 34 year olds living with their parents were male in 2015, that is almost 1 in 3 (31%) men aged 20 to 34 compared to one in five women.\n\nIn addition to financial reasons, what are some of the other factors that may affect the number of young adults living at home?\n###Delays in formalising relationships\nThe formalisation of relationships (getting married, forming a civil partnership or cohabiting with a partner) is occurring at older ages. The average age at first marriage^11^ for men in England and Wales was 32 years in 2012 compared with 29 years in 1996. For women, the average age at first marriage in 2012 was slightly lower than for men (30 years), but was still higher than the average age for women 16 years earlier (27 years).\n\nWomen are more likely to form relationships with older partners so more women aged 20 to 34 are likely to be living in a couple compared to men. In the 20 to 34 age group, over 620,000 more women than men were living as part of a couple in their own household in 2015.\n\nWomen now have more choice over when, or whether, to have children. The average age for women in England and Wales to have their first birth^12^ was 29 years in 2014 compared with 27 years in 1996. In the past having children earlier may have been a driver for young adults to leave the parental home at a younger age.\n###Lone parents and concealed families\nYoung women are more likely to become a lone parent when a relationship breaks down. In the 20 to 34 age group, there were more than 551,000 more female lone parents compared to male lone parents in 2015.\n\nLone mothers or fathers may live independently or choose to stay living with their parents, forming ‘concealed families’ ^13^ within the parental home. These young adults have not been included in the count of young adults living with their parents for this analysis. By excluding concealed families, the total number of young adults living with their parents is lowered. This tends to affect the numbers of young women more than young men living with their parents as women are more likely to be caring for children and therefore form a concealed family.\n###Housing benefit- changes to welfare\nThe recent changes to housing benefit entitlement^14^ for those aged under 35 is also likely to have had some impact on young adults being able to leave the parental home. Research suggests that this is more likely to affect young males, particularly non-resident fathers, than young females.^15^ This is because non-resident fathers by definition won’t have their children living with them and so are only entitled to the costs of living in a room in a shared house; this may discourage young males from leaving the parental home or encourage them to move back in with their parents after the breakdown of a relationship.\n###Staying in education for longer\nIncreasing numbers of young adults are also choosing to stay in education for longer. In 2015, the number of young adults aged 18 to 24 in full-time education was 1.9 million, an increase of 791,000 (72%) from just over 1.1 million in 1996.^16^\n\nIncreasing numbers of young adults are also choosing to stay at home while attending university. In 2014, 24% of UK University undergraduates opted to stay at home living with parents whilst studying, compared with 12% in 1996. This may be because these young adults are trying to reduce their living costs while studying at university. Additionally many young adults are choosing to return to their parental home after completing their studies.\n\nFurther research on the impact of the housing market, welfare changes and housing policy on young adults leaving home can be found in analysis such as ['Young Adults’ Transitions to Residential Independence in the UK: The Role of Social and Housing Policy’][16] by Berrington and colleagues.\n\n\n\nFor more information on housing data e-mail <hpi@ons.gov.uk> and for more information on the living arrangements of younger people e-mail <families@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n  [1]: http://press.conservatives.com/post/130746609060/prime-minister-conference-speech-2015\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc315/chart1/line_chart/data.csv\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc315/chart2/line_chart/data.csv\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc315/chart3/line_chart/data.csv\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc315/chart5/line_chart/data2.csv\n  [6]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ashe/annual-survey-of-hours-and-earnings/2014-revised-results/rft-6.zip\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/datasets/housepriceindexannualtables2039/current\n  [8]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171776_368928.pdf\n  [9]: http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN05871/SN05871.pdf\n  [10]: https://www.cml.org.uk/site-search/?keywords=ml2\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/marriagecohabitationandcivilpartnerships/bulletins/marriagesinenglandandwalesprovisional/2014-06-11\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/birthsbyparentscharacteristicsinenglandandwales/2014\n  [13]: https://www.gov.uk/housing-benefit/eligibility\n  [14]: http://www.cpc.ac.uk/publications/cpc_working_papers/pdf/2013_WP38_Future_Research_Agenda_for_Studies_of_Young_Adults_Transitions_to_Residential_Independence_Berrington_et_al.pdf\n  [15]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/january-2016/statistical-bulletin.html\n  [16]: http://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781137370518\n  [17]: mailto:hpi@ons.gov.uk\n  [18]: mailto:families@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

      "markdown": "The inequality between health bodies in England in terms of one-year cancer survival estimates narrowed between 1998 and 2013, [newly-released figures show][1].\n\nThe latest figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that over that 15-year period the percentage of cancer patients surviving longer than a year increased from 60% to 70%.\n\nThe difference between the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) with the highest and lowest survival rates narrowed from 13% to 11%. CCGs are the bodies responsible for planning and commissioning local health care services in England.\n\nOne-year cancer survival estimates are used by NHS England to monitor the performance of CCGs. Some CCGs also use the survival estimates to monitor their own performance and set strategic priorities.\n###How much have cancer survival estimates improved?\n####One-year cancer survival estimates by CCG, England 1998 to 2013\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc316/line_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"One-year cancer survival estimates by CCG, England 1998 to 2013\"/>\n\n[Download the data][2]\n\nIn 1998 there was a 13 percentage point gap in one-year survival between the lowest (NHS Newham with 52%) and highest (NHS Leeds North with 65%) areas.\n\nFor patients aged 15 to 99, who were diagnosed in 2013, the gap between the lowest (NHS Newham at 64%) and highest (NHS Harrow & NHS Barnet at 75%) areas was 11 percentage points.\n\nOverall, one-year survival estimates over the past 15 years have improved for each CCG.\n\nNHS Central Manchester, NHS Hounslow and NHS South Kent Coast are examples of CCGs which have improved survival by more than 15 percentage points or more.\n\nThe smallest improvements of fewer than five percentage points were in NHS South Reading which improved from 62% in 1998 to 66% and NHS Crawley, which changed from 62% to 65%.\n###Find out how one-year survival estimates have changed in your area\n####One-year cancer survival estimates by CCG, England 1998 and 2013\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc316/dots/content.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"One-year cancer survival estimates by CCG, England 1998 and 2013\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3]\n\nIn general, the largest increases between 1998 and 2013 were in areas where survival was lower in 1998. For example, one-year survival in NHS Newham CCG (lowest survival estimate in 1998) increased by 12 percentage points between 1998 and 2013, and by 8 percentage points in NHS Leeds North CCG (highest survival estimate in 1998).\n\nThe average one-year survival increase for those CCGs ranked in the bottom 20% in 1998 increased by 13 percentage points - from 56% to 68% in 2013.\n\nThose CCGs in the top 20% in 1998 saw an 8 percentage point rise in their one-year survival estimate, from 63% to 71% in 2013. However, those in the bottom group were starting from a lower survival estimate and therefore had greater room for improvement.\n\nSome CCGs have seen dramatic changes in their survival ranking since 1998; NHS Hounslow has moved from the bottom 20% of all the CCGs to the top 20%, while NHS Swindon and NHS Scarborough & Ryedale have moved from the top 20% of survival to the bottom 20%.\n\n####Percentage point difference in one-year cancer survival estimates by CCG, England 1998 to 2013\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc316/map/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage point difference in one-year cancer survival estimates by CCG, England 1998 to 2013\"/>\n\n[Download the data][4]\n\n###Background\n\n- In 1998, Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) were responsible for the commissioning of health services, including cancer treatment. They were replaced by 211 CCGs in April 2013. This number has since been reduced to 209.\n\n- Although the current CCGs were not responsible for the commissioning of cancer services, these statistics give an indication of the relative changes in cancer survival for each CCG since 1998.\n\n- Cancer survival is only one set of information among a lot of other data available to measure the performance of the CCG. It should be seen as a guide to raise questions about the potential for improvement.\n\n- Not all cancer patients who live in the territory assigned to a CCG are registered with a GP practice included in that CCG.\n\n- Patterns of cancer occurrence by age, sex and type of cancer can shift quite quickly over time, especially in small areas. The survival estimates used in this piece are designed to reflect real change - it is intended to change only if cancer survival itself actually changes and for long-term monitoring of progress in overall cancer survival.\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/cancersurvivalforclinicalcommissioninggroupsengland2014\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/02/data.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/02/dots.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/02/map.csv\n  [5]: mailto:digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk\n"

By 2015, this had more than doubled to 5.2 million – 16.7% of the workforce.^2^\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/sunday-trading-02.png\"/>][1]\n\nThe [Labour Force Survey][2] shows that in 1994, of those who usually work on Sunday, 6.8% were in sales occupations (which include retail sales, as well as occupations like customer services and call centres).\n\nBy 2015, this share had risen to 12.6%.^3^\n\nThe numbers of men and women usually working on Sundays in sales jobs have more than quadrupled between 1994 and 2015. By 2015, there were 382,000 women working in Sunday sales jobs compared with 265,000 men.\n\nOf the people who say they usually work on Sunday, and are in sales occupations, 59.1% were women in 2015, compared to 56.5% in 1994\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/sunday-trading-011.png\"/>][3]\n\nIn 1994, 24.3% of people usually working on Sundays were part-time, rising to 31.6% in 2015. In sales occupations, the share of part-time workers is much higher than in other occupational groups. In 2015, 58.2% of those in sales jobs who usually work on Sundays were part-time.\n\nAs well as those in sales occupations, many other professional groups have been increasingly working on Sundays.\n\nBetween 1994 and 2015, the three other occupational groups that have seen an increase in their share of employment among those people who usually work on Sunday are professional occupations, skilled trades occupations and elementary/other occupations.\n\n###Competition from online shopping\n\nBusiness secretary, Sajid Javid, who is sponsoring the bill,  explained one reason for shaking up the 20-year-old laws on Sunday trading was because it meant larger retailers could not compete with the change in shopping habits to online purchasing.\n\nThe first liberalisation of Sunday trading hours in the mid 1990s coincided with the birth of online shopping websites such as Amazon and ebay, now global conglomerates which have no opening hours.\n\n[ONS figures][4] shine a spotlight on the extent of the movement to online shopping; 77% of men and 75% of women now shop online, 2015 figures show. This is up from 57% for men and 49% for women in 2008.^4^\n\n###Slow and steady increase in retail trade\n\nUnder current rules, which came into force in 1994, larger stores are restricted to a maximum Sunday opening of six consecutive hours, between 10am and 6pm. Smaller shops can open whenever they want.\n\nSince the Sunday Trading Act came into force in July 1994, there has been a gradual increase in the proportion of retail trade overall.^5^\n\nWhen looking at sales data from the subsequent months of July, we see a small and steady annual growth.\n\nIn July 1995, a year after the Sunday Trading Act came into force, there had been a 3.9% growth, followed by 5.6% in 1996 and 6.4% 1997.\n\nAlthough this data does not confirm that Sunday trading has been responsible for the increase in sales.\n\n\nThe original data source can be found on the [ONS website.][6]\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/sunday-trading-02.png\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/sunday-trading-011.png\n  [4]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rdit2/e-commerce-and-internet-use/5-facts-relating-to-web-sales/sty-5-facts.html\n  [5]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/datasets/poundsdatatotalretailsales\n  [6]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/adhocs/005455peopleinemploymentwhousuallyworkonasundayaged16andoverukapriltojunequarter21994and2015\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

This isn’t surprising as life expectancy has been steadily increasing, so State Pensions are being claimed for longer. The remaining life expectancy for someone aged 65 years, in 2016, is 21 years for a man and 24 years for a woman. To find out how long your pension pot might need to last, [check out our interactive here][2].\n####How much do we spend on care?\nAround £30 billion is spent on personal social services. About £44 billion goes on benefits for people who are ill or disabled, while £10 billion goes on elderly care payments.\n\n####How much do we spend on working age people?\nOver £46 billion goes on family benefits, income support and tax credits. This includes benefits such as Child Benefit and support for people on low income. Around £2.2 billion goes to the unemployed.\n\nAs for unemployed people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance or Universal Credit, there were 804,100 people claiming these benefits in September 2017.

      "markdown": "In 2015 the UK public sector received £671 billion, spent £753 billion, borrowed £82 billion, had a current budget deficit of £46 billion and at the end of 2015 a debt of just over £1.6 trillion (or 84% of GDP)^1^.\n\nSo just what do all these numbers mean? Here, we explain.\n###First of all what is the public sector?\nThe public sector includes central government, local government, the Bank of England and other public corporations.\n###What does it do with money?\nIt receives and spends money continually throughout the year.\n\nThe money it receives mainly comes from taxes (such as income tax and VAT) and social contributions (such as National Insurance) but it also comes from rents, fines, licences and interest payments on money it has lent out.\n\nThe money it spends goes on two different areas:\n\n- Current spending - the cost of running the country from day to day. This is the main area of spending and includes paying benefits (such as state pensions and child benefit), the costs of running local government and central government departments (such as health, education and defence), paying grants and paying the interest on the government’s debt.\n- Capital spending - the net cost of investment. This is what the public sector spends on building assets like roads and buildings plus what it spends on providing grants to the private sector, minus what is gets from selling assets.\n\n###What happens if public sector income and spending do not match up?\nIf the public sector receives more than it spends, it is said to be in “surplus”.\n\nIn contrast when the public sector spends more than it receives it has to borrow the difference. When this happens the public sector is said to be in “deficit”.\n\nHowever there are two common ways of looking at the deficit:\n\n- The difference between the money it receives and current (or day to day) spending. This figure is called the “Current Budget Deficit” - £46 billion in 2015.\n- The difference between the money it receives and current (or day to day) spending together with capital spending.This figure is called “Public Sector Net Borrowing” (PSNB) - £82 billion in 2015.\n\nThe most widely used figure when talking about the public sector deficit is the PSNB figure. So in this piece, when we use the term “the deficit” we will be referring to the PSNB figure.\n\n####UK public sector spending, income, surplus and deficit^2^, 1993 to 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc302/line_chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK public sector spending, income, surplus and deficit^2^, 1993 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data][1]\n\n###So is deficit the same as debt?\n\nNo. The difference between debt and deficit is that deficit represents the difference between income and spending at one point in time while debt represents the total amount of money owed, built up over a period of time. So reducing the deficit is not the same as reducing the debt.\n\nTo make this more clear, let’s imagine this:\n\nA person overspends by £100 for five years – this is a deficit of £100 for five years running with an accumulated debt of £500.\n\nThey then manage to only overspend by £50 for the next three years  - this is a deficit of £50 for three years running with a total accumulated debt of £650.\n\nThey then manage to actually save £100 for two years  - this is a surplus of £100 for two years running, reducing the total accumulated debt to £450.\n\nSo even though they reduced their deficit after five years and ran a surplus for the last two years, they are still left with a debt of £450.\n\n####Illustration of deficit, surplus and accumulated debt \n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/11/Deficit-Debt-FINAL.png\"/>][2]\n\nSo whenever the public sector has to borrow to fund its yearly spending plans (i.e. runs a deficit), it will normally lead to an increase in the overall level of debt.^3^  Even if the deficit is reduced, the debt continues to rise, just at a slower rate. The debt can be significantly reduced if the public sector starts running a surplus and uses this money to pay off accumulated debt.\n\nUK public sector debt was £1.5 trillion andthe public sector deficit was £82 billion in 2015.\n\n####UK public sector debt and deficit^4^, 1993 to 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc302/line_chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK public sector debt and deficit^4^, 1993 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3]\n\nComparing the two lines we can see that while the deficit has been on a downward trend since 2009, the level of debt has been continually rising. This is mainly because the UK public sector continues to run a deficit – which has been adding to the overall level of debt.\n###But what about interest on the debt?\nWe must also remember that in the example above we assumed a 0% interest rate. In the real world the public sector debt comes with interest that needs to be paid every year and the bigger the debt, the bigger the interest payments. In the year 2000 the public sector spent £26 billion on paying the interest on the debt, by 2011 it had risen to £46 billion and in 2015 it spent £36 billion^5^.\n\n\nUK public sector spending on debt interest was £36 billion in 2015.\n\n###So how can the UK afford this debt?\nThe debt figure may seem very large but we do need to consider it in context. This is why we often see it expressed as a percentage of UK GDP (Gross Domestic Product).\n\nThink of it this way, if I say I borrowed £1 million last year that sounds like a lot of money. But if I then say that last year I produced goods and services valued at £10 million, the borrowing only amounts to 10% of what I actually produced. Because the amount I borrowed has been put into context, it sounds more reasonable.\n\nThe same concept applies when expressing the public sector debt as a percentage of GDP because GDP measures the total value of everything the UK produces. This concept is also useful (and often used) when talking about the deficit or any large items of public sector spending.\n\nIn 2015 the UK public sector debt stood at £1.6 trillion, this was equivalent to 84% of UK GDP.\n\nUK public sector debt was 84% of GDP in 2015.\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/11/debt-and-deficit-chart-1-final.csv\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/11/Deficit-Debt-FINAL.png\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/11/debt-and-deficit-chart-2.csv\n  [4]: mailto:psa@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n####Footnotes:\n1. These figures, and all others used in this piece are for calendar years, not financial years.\n2. In the UK Public Sector Finances, the income measure is called 'revenue', the spending measure is the sum of 'total current expenditure', 'depreciation' and 'total net investment', and the deficit measure is 'Public Sector Net Borrowing'. All data are excluding public sector banks. Deficit/surplus figures have been rounded and may not be shown as the exact difference between spending and income.\n3. A deficit will not always lead to an increase in debt - only when the government chooses to fund it by adding to the overall level of debt.\n4. The debt measure shown here is Public Sector Net Debt, excluding public banks and the deficit measure is Public Sector Net Borrowing, excluding public banks.\n5. These are nominal figures."

However, there are more low paid workers in large businesses in absolute terms.\n\nThe impact of the NLW on businesses will depend on a number of factors, including:\n- The number of employees who were paid below the NLW before April 1, 2016.\n- Whether or not wages made up a large part of total costs before April 1, 2016.\n\n###The NLW is likely to have the biggest impact on businesses in the accommodation and food service industry\n\n####Percentage of employees in each industry paid below the NLW before April 1, 2016, UK\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc324/chart3_industry/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of employees in each industry paid below the NLWÂ� before April 1, 2016, UK\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n\nThe industries with the highest proportions of employees paid below the NLW before April 1, 2016 were: accommodation and food services (33.2%), administrative and support services (16.9%) and wholesale and retail trade (13.4%). Therefore, businesses in these industries are more likely to feel the impact of the NLW than businesses in other industries.\n\nThe NLW is not likely to have such a big impact on businesses in the electricity, gas and steam industry, where just 0.3% of employees were paid below the NLW, or public administration and defence, where the proportion was 0.4%. It is also not likely to have much impact on the mining and quarrying industry, where the proportion was 0.5%.\n\nThe different proportions of employees earning below the NLW before April 1, 2016 is likely to be because of the different skill levels of the employees in these different industries. In the case of public administration and defence it may also be because the Government tended to pay above the NLW.\n###The NLW is likely to have a considerable impact on businesses in 'low pay industries'\nTaking a closer look at industries, analysis by the Low Pay Commission has identified several '[low pay industries][8].' More than 10% of employees in each of these industries were paid below the NLW before April 1, 2016 and so there is likely to be a considerable impact on businesses in these industries.\n\n####Percentage of employees in ‘low pay industries’ paid below the NLW before April 1, 2016, UK\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc324/chart4_lowpay/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of employees in â€˜low pay industriesâ€™ paid below the NLWÂ� before April 1, 2016, UK\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][9]\n\nThere is likely to be a particularly large impact on the cleaning, hospitality and hairdressing industries, where more than a quarter of employees were paid below the NLW before April 1, 2016.\n\n\n\n####Notes\n- The National Living Wage (NLW) of £7.20 relates to hourly pay excluding overtime and shift premium pay. Employees in the first year of an apprenticeship are not entitled to the £7.20 hourly rate. See [more][10] about the NLW.\n- All data in this article is from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), which is based on a 1% sample of employee jobs taken from HM Revenue and Customs' Pay As You Earn (PAYE) records. Consequently, individuals with more than one job may appear in the sample more than once.  Employee jobs are defined as those held by employees and not the self-employed.  In this article 'employee jobs' are referred to as 'employees.' Figures are based on employees aged 25 and over whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence.  Activities of households as employers and extraterritorial organisations are excluded from this analysis.\n- The figures in this article come from analysis of the ASHE data on wages from April 2015. Between April 2015 and April 2016 (when the NLW became law), wages grew. Therefore it is not best practise to compare 2015 wages data with the £7.20 NLW that came into force in April 2016. Instead we have used a downrated NLW of £6.83. This follows [analysis][11] by the Low Pay Commission.\n- All the data used in this article can be accessed on the [ONS website][12].\n- The pay comparison tool in this article calculates your annual salary from the information you put in. It then calculates what someone on the NLW would earn if they worked your hours, using the £7.20 NLW rate.\n\n\n\n  [1]: #Notes\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/NLW-ages-data-download.csv\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dev3/ONS_SOC_hierarchy_view.html\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dev3/ONS_SOC_hierarchy_view.html\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/occupation-NLW-chart-data-download.csv\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/04/Over-25s-classed-as-low-pay.csv\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/NLW-industry-data-download.csv\n  [8]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-minimum-wage-low-pay-commission-report-2014\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/NLW-Low-pay-industries-data-download-.csv\n  [10]: https://www.livingwage.gov.uk/?gclid=CjwKEAjw_ci3BRDSvfjortr--DQSJADU8f2j2iUZj7h7nyMOnv1nPM7fLGhjsm_t2dnv2N7grE-ychoCB9Pw_wcB\n  [11]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/507455/10493-TSO-Low_Pay-ACCESSIBLE_05.pdf\n  [12]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/adhocs/005540annualsurveyofhoursandearningsashepercentageofemployeesearningbelow683april2015uk\n  [13]: mailto:earnings@ons.gov.uk\n"

However, these numbers will be an underestimate of those who had respiratory disease, at or around the time of death, as it is not always recorded as the underlying cause of death.\n\nThe predominant circulating flu virus in 2015 was influenza A(H3N2) a strain known to predominantly affect older people.\n\nThere were numerous reported outbreaks in care homes, higher than expected numbers of admissions to hospital and intensive care for flu and evidence that the flu vaccine was less effective than in previous years.\n\nThe peak in influenza admissions to intensive care occurred in January, at the same time as the peak increase in deaths.\n\nDementia and Alzheimer's disease deaths were well above the five-year average throughout the year, particularly so between January and March 2015, and have shown a general upward trend over the last decade. The reasons for this may be partly related to attempts across the health system to [improve the diagnosis of people][3] with dementia.\n\nHowever, it may be related to the greater vulnerability to respiratory diseases of people with these conditions, difficulties with self-care and falls, all of which may be more important in winter months.\n\nGenerally more than a third of deaths with an underlying cause of dementia or Alzheimer's disease also have a respiratory disease mentioned on the death certificate. This was true of deaths in 2015.\n###There has been a fall in life expectancy\nPeriod life expectancy[^1^](#notes) Life expectancy figures are based on a provisional extract of deaths and population figures for 2015, taken from the ONS series of Principal Population Projections.\n\nAn increase in the number of deaths has a direct impact on the provisional life expectancy at birth for England and Wales. This has dropped by 0.2 years for males (to 79.3 years) and 0.3 years for females (to 82.9 years) since 2014, according to provisional mortality rates for 2015.\n\n\n\nFor information on diagnosis of dementia, click on [Challenge on Dementia][4] and on the [ Mandate from the Government to the NHS][5].\n\n<h4 id=\"notes\">Notes:</h4>\n1 - Life expectancy figures are based on a provisional extract of deaths and population figures for 2015, taken from the ONS series of Principal Population Projections.\n\n Death rates are likely to change in the future, so period life expectancy does not therefore give the number of years someone could actually expect to live.\n\n Official life expectancy figures for 2015 will be calculated by ONS using the final annual release of 2015 deaths and mid-year population estimates for 2015, published in the summer of 2016.\n\n Period life expectancies are a useful summary measure of mortality rates as they are age-standardised, and therefore take into account differences in the age structure of populations, allowing valid comparisons to be made over time and between different geographical areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/04/Figure-1.xls\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/04/Figure-3.xls\n  [3]: https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/dementia/\n  [4]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prime-ministers-challenge-on-dementia-2020\n  [5]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/486818/mndate-NHSE-15_16.pdf\n  [6]: mailto:digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk\n"

      "markdown": "A blanket ban of so-called ‘legal highs’ is due to come into effect this spring, following long-running concerns over how quickly they are being created and the potential harms they pose.\n\n\n\nThe [Psychoactive Substances Act 2016][1] will outlaw the importation, production and supply of psychoactive substances, although alcohol, tobacco, caffeine and most medicines will be exempt.\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">\n**What are ‘legal highs’?**<br/>\n‘Legal highs’ contain chemicals which produce similar psychoactive effects to ‘traditional’ illegal drugs like cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy.\n\nThere is no agreed official list of substances that are categorised as legal highs, but this article concentrates on the following types of substances:\n\n• Stimulants like piperazines (eg BZP), cathinones (eg mephedrone), benzofurans and methiopropamine<br/>\n• Sedatives such as benzodiazepine analogues (eg etizolam) and new synthetic opioids<br/>\n• Hallucinogenic drugs like NBOMes and alpha-methyltryptamine<br/>\n• Dissociatives, eg methoxetamine<br/>\n• Synthetic cannabinoids such as 5FAKB-48<br/>\n\nThis article focuses on substances that were not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 on the day the person died.\n</ons-box>\n\n\n###Concerns over ‘legal highs’\n‘Legal highs’ first started to become more popular on the UK drugs scene in around 2008/09, with synthetic stimulants such as benzylpiperazine (BZP) and mephedrone, and synthetic cannabinoids such as Spice, among the first to gain popularity.\n\nThere has long been concern, since then, over deaths connected to ‘legal highs’ such as mephedrone; each fatality bringing with it an outcry for something to be done to prevent further tragedies.\n\nThe government has already banned a large number of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS) under the [Misuse of Drugs Act 1971][2].\n\nHowever, it has been difficult to control the use of NPS with existing legislation, and the number on the market has increased rapidly in recent years.\n\nThere were 76 deaths involving 'legal highs' (ie an NPS not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act on the day the person died), in England and Wales between 2004 and 2013.\n\nThere has been a marked rise in the number of deaths connected to ‘legal highs’ between 2011 and 2013, when they more than tripled from seven to 23.\n\nFive out of six legal high deaths are among men.\n\nIn 2013 alone, there were 23 deaths where ‘legal highs’ were a factor.\n\nThese trends should be interpreted with caution as they are based on very small numbers.\n\n####Number of deaths involving legal highs, England and Wales, 2004 to 2013\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc327/Legal_Highs/LH_connected/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Number of deaths involving legal highs, England and Wales, 2004 to 2013\"/>\n\nOver the same period there were more than 100 times as many deaths involving heroin or morphine (7,748) and more than 20 times as many deaths involving cocaine (1,752).\n\n\n\n####Drug related deaths, England and Wales, 2004 to 2013\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/04/legal-hs_v3white_vis_nologo-005.png\"/>][3]\n\n\n\n###Most legal high deaths happen in people aged 20 to 29\nThe average (median) age for deaths involving a legal high is 28, which is younger than for drug misuse deaths, where the average age is 38. The youngest person to die from taking a legal high was aged 18 and between 2004 and 2013 only nine teenagers have died from this.\n\nLittle research has been carried out into the short or long-term harms of ‘legal highs’. So users are effectively acting as human guinea pigs, because they cannot be sure what substance they are actually taking, how much to take, or the effect it will have.\n####Around 60% of legal high deaths also involve another drug or alcohol\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc327/Legal_Highs/LH_split/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Around 60% of legal high deaths also involve another drug or alcohol\"/>\n\nMore than half of all legal high deaths involved multiple drugs (57% on average between 2004 and 2013), but this proportion dropped to about a third in 2013. This could be a combination of legal highs and illegal drugs or a mixture of different legal highs.\n\nWhere more than one drug is mentioned it is impossible to tell which was primarily responsible for the death.\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">\n**Street names for 'legal highs':**<br/>\n'Legal highs' cannot be labelled as being for human consumption, so are often marketed as plant food, bath salts, incense or research chemicals:\n\n• Spice<br/>\n• Clockwork Orange<br/>\n• Bliss<br/>\n• Ivory wave<br/>\n</ons-box>\n\n\nAlcohol was involved in about 10% of legal high deaths between 2004 and 2013, though none of the 23 deaths in 2013 mentioned it.\n###Does banning a new psychoactive substance reduce deaths?\nMephedrone was one of the first legal highs to catch the media’s attention. Sometimes called ‘Meow meow’ or ‘M-Cat’ by the media, it is a [cathinone][4] substance which was controlled as a Class B substance under the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) on April 16, 2010, along with a number of other cathinones.\n\nBut deaths involving mephedrone did not immediately fall after it was banned. In fact they continued to rise for several years afterwards, peaking at 22 deaths in 2012, before falling to 12 deaths in 2013.\n\n####Deaths involving mephedrone, England and Wales, 2009 to 2013\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc327/Legal_Highs/LH_death/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Deaths involving mephedrone, England and Wales, 2009 to 2013\"/>\n\nDeaths involving mephedrone spiked between 2009 and 2012, despite evidence that mephedrone use was falling ([Crime Survey for England and Wales][5]). This could be down to people taking mephedrone in combination with other more dangerous substances, or using riskier methods to take it (eg injecting instead of snorting).\n\nIt’s also possible that prolonged use of the drug caused increasing harm, with escalating doses leading to more fatal overdoses; or it is possible that a more vulnerable group of people began using mephedrone. In addition, it may be that people stockpiled mephedrone before it was banned, which could have affected patterns of use after the ban.\n\nThere may be a complex relationship between a drug’s legal status, how widely it is used in the population and the number of deaths that occur.\n\nOnly time will tell if the blanket ban on NPS will affect the number of deaths associated with them.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/2/contents/enacted\n  [2]: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/contents\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/04/legal-hs_v3white_vis_nologo-005.png\n  [4]: http://www.talktofrank.com/search/apachesolr_search/cathinone\n  [5]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/tables-for-drug-misuse-findings-from-the-2014-to-2015-csew\n"

People who lived in a workless household at age 14 were around one and a half times as likely to be in poverty, compared with those where one adult was working.\n\nWhen we take into account a person’s educational attainment, some other childhood factors such as the financial situation of the household when they were 14 are no longer significant predictors of current poverty.\n\nThis suggests that household income during childhood mainly impacts a person’s future income prospects through their educational attainment.\n\n###Severe material deprivation and educational attainment\n\nSevere material deprivation[^3^](#footnote3) provides an estimate of people whose living conditions are affected by not being able to afford items including being able to pay rent, mortgage and utility bills.\n\nIn the UK, after accounting for other factors, those with low personal education level are 11 times more likely to be severely deprived as those with a high level of education.[^4^](#footnote4)\n\nParental employment during childhood also factored into the likelihood of deprivation in later life. The odds of experiencing severe material deprivation now are almost twice as high for those whose father was unemployed, compared with those who worked in a managerial role.\n\nThose who lived in a single parent household at age 14 are more than twice as likely to be severely materially deprived now as those who lived with both parents.\n\n\n\nMore information can be found in [Intergenerational Transmission of Disadvantage in the UK and EU. ][1]\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/household-income/intergenerational-transmission-of-poverty-in-the-uk---eu/2014/blank.html\n  [2]: mailto:hie@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n<h6 id=\"footnote1\">1.</h6>  There may be other childhood characteristics which affect the chances of being in relative income poverty as an adult which were not possible to include in this analysis as data weren’t available.\nOther childhood factors that have previously been suggested which weren’t accounted for in this analysis include genetic ability, the quality and nature of early childcare, and the nature of the home environment more broadly.\n\n<h6 id=\"footnote2\">2.</h6> For the purpose of this analysis, relative low income was used as an indicator of poverty.

      "markdown": "This article presents some key data on the UK economy and UK economic policy from 1980 until the present day, and covers three themes – economic output and trade, inflation and interest rates and public sector finances (deficits and debts).\n\nOther economic aspects have been covered elsewhere in the [UK Perspectives series][1], which presents an overview of the social and economic changes that have occurred in the UK over the last three decades.\n###Economic output and trade\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of economic output produced within a country in a given period. Real GDP is a measure of economic output adjusted for price changes.</ons-box>\n###The UK economy is growing\nReal GDP growth year-on-year, UK, 1980 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc343/Economy_Chart1/Economy_Chart1.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Real GDP growth year-on-year\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][2]\n\nReal GDP in the UK has typically increased every year. Over the period 1980 to 2015, real GDP growth has averaged 2.2% per year, although there have been three downturns in the economy since 1980. After the downturn in the early 1990s, the UK economy experienced 16 consecutive years of growth before output fell in 2008 and 2009. From 2010, output has been growing again – regaining pre-downturn levels in the third quarter of 2013. Real GDP grew by 2.3% between 2014 and 2015, down from a 2.9% growth rate between 2013 and 2014.\n\nReal GDP per head, UK, 1980 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc343/Economy_Chart2/Economy_Chart2.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"GDP per capita\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][3]\n\nThe rate of growth in UK real GDP has exceeded the rate of growth in UK population since 1980, with real UK GDP per head 91% higher in 2015 than in 1980. In 2015, real GDP per head reached £27,505, which was the first time it was above the pre-economic downturn level (£27,183) in 2007.\n###UK productivity levels remain subdued\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Productivity is one of the most important drivers of economic growth. Productivity measures how efficiently inputs, such as labour, are being used in the economy to produce a level of output. When productivity increases, more is produced with the same amount of inputs. This section focuses on labour productivity defined as output per hour worked.</ons-box>\n\n####Output per hour worked growth year-on-year, UK, 1980 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc343/Economy_Chart3/Economy_Chart3.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Output per hour worked growth year-on-year, UK, 1980 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][4]\n\nLabour productivity has grown on average by 1.8% per year between 1980 and 2015. However, since the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009, productivity growth has increased much more slowly compared with its pre-downturn peak, fluctuating between -1% and 1% per year.\n\nThis recent weakness of UK labour productivity relative to its longer term trend has been labelled the 'productivity puzzle' and is likely to be caused by a number of factors, including weak consumer demand and businesses deciding to retain staff until demand picks up.\n###Exports and imports continue to increase, but the UK has run a trade deficit since 1998\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Trade balance equals exports minus imports. A country has a trade surplus if it exports more than it imports (positive trade balance). A trade deficit occurs if a country imports more than it exports (negative trade balance).</ons-box>\n\n####Imports, exports and trade balance, UK, 1980 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc343/Economy_Chart4/Economy_Chart4.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Imports, exports and trade balance, UK, 1980 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][5]\n\nInternational trade can benefit consumers and producers, providing them with a wider range of goods and services.\n\nIn the UK imports and exports have been growing over time, both increasing by almost 90% since 2000. However, imports have been higher than exports since the late 1990s - meaning the UK has been running a trade deficit. The last time the UK ran a trade surplus was in 1997.\n\nThe UK balance of trade can be looked at in more detail by breaking it down into goods and services. The UK tends to run a deficit on its trade in goods (imports of goods exceed exports of goods), but a surplus on its services (exports of services exceed imports of services) balance of trade.\n##Inflation and interest rates\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The Bank of England is responsible for price stability (inflation) in the UK. The inflation rate measures the rate at which the average prices of goods and services change, and the Bank of England’s goal is to maintain this rate close to the 2% target. The Bank of England inflation target is based on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). The CPI is calculated using the prices of a specific “shopping basket” of items that is representative of consumer spending patterns on items such as energy, food and clothing.</ons-box>\n###Prices rose 0.3% in the year to April 2016\nInflation rate, January 1989 to April 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc343/Economy_Chart5/Economy_Chart5.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Inflation rate\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][6]\n\nConsumer prices rose 0.3% in the year ending April 2016, compared with a 0.5% increase in the previous month.\n###Interest rates are at record low levels\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The Bank of England is responsible for maintaining price stability (controlling inflation) – it does so primarily by setting the 'base' interest rate.</ons-box>\n\n####Bank of England interest rates, 1 January 1980 to 12 May 2016^1^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc343/Economy_Chart6/Economy_Chart6.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Bank of England interest rates, 1 January 1980 to 12 May 2016^1^\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n\nThe primary method that the Bank of England uses to maintain price stability is the interest rate at which it lends to financial institutions. This rate affects the rates set by other financial institutions, including lending rates offered to businesses and individuals.\n\nThe official bank rate has been 0.5% since March 2009, which is very low compared with historic trends. A low interest rate reduces the cost of borrowing and makes savings less attractive – so people invest and consume more.\n###Public sector finances (deficits and debts)^2^\n<ons-box align=\"full\">If government spending is higher than income, it’s operating what is known as a deficit. Public sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks (PSNB ex) is the most widely accepted measure of the overall government deficit (or surplus).</ons-box>\n###The UK has typically been in deficit since 1980\n####UK government net borrowing ('deficit'), financial year ending 1981 to financial year ending 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc343/Economy_Chart7/Economy_Chart7/Economy_Chart7.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK government net borrowing ('deficit'), financial year ending 1981 to financial year ending 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][8]\n\nGovernment expenditure has been larger than government income for most years since 1980, which is why the UK has typically been in deficit since 1980. Indeed, the UK Government has been in deficit in most years since the Second World War, when current records began.\n\nIn the financial year ending 2009, the deficit rose sharply following the global financial shock, peaking the following financial year at £154.7 billion. Since then the deficit has reduced to £74.0 billion (first estimate) in the financial year ending 2016.\n###UK government debt as a percentage of GDP has been rising\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The level of government debt indicates how much the government owes in total. It's broadly speaking an accumulation of each year’s deficit, and the government must pay interest payments on this debt. Government mainly raises money through issuing bonds (also known as 'gilts'). Bond interest rates are mostly fixed for the lifetime of the bond, the level at which that interest is set will reflect a number of factors, including market interest rates and the perceived ability of the government to pay back and service its debt. Interest rates on new UK government debt are currently very low.</ons-box>\n\nUK government debt as a percentage of GDP, financial year ending 1980 to financial year ending 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc343/Economy_Chart8/Economy_Chart8.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK government debt as a percentage of GDP\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][9]\n\nThe government has operated a deficit most financial years since the financial year ending 1981. As a consequence, the total level of debt has also risen in almost every year since that time. In the financial year ending 2008, prior to the economic downturn, the level of debt was £562bn. By the financial year ending 2016, it had risen to £1,594 bn.\n\nThe level of debt is often expressed as a percentage of GDP. Debt ranged between 24.2% and 45.6% of GDP over the period financial year ending 1981 to financial year ending 2008. In the financial year ending 2016, it reached 83.5% of GDP.\n\nInterest payments on public sector debt as a percentage of government expenditure, UK, financial year ending 1981 to financial year ending 2015 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc343/Economy_Chart9/Economy_Chart9.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Public sector debt interest as a percentage of Total Managed Expenditure\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][10]\n\nThe size of the government debt affects the size of government interest repayments. As with other types of debt, the cost of interest repayments is affected both by the size of the debt and the interest rate. The interest to be paid on some government bonds is linked to inflation. The current relatively low inflation partly explains why debt interest payments as a share of government expenditure since financial year ending 2009 have remained below the share seen in the mid to late 1990s, despite the higher levels of the overall debt. Public sector debt interest as a percentage of total current expenditure in the financial year ending 2015 was 5.4%.\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/introducing-uk-perspectives-2016\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/UKP-Economy-Fig-1-GDP-growth.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/UKP-Economy-Fig-2-GDP-per-capita1.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/UKP-Economy-Fig-3-output-per-hour-worked-growth.csv\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/UKP-Economy-Fig-4-trade.csv\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/UKP-Economy-Fig-5-inflation-rate-v2.csv\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/UKP-Economy-Fig-6-interest-rate.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/UKP-Economy-Fig-7-deficit.csv\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/UKP-Economy-Fig-8-debt.csv\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/UKP-Economy-Fig-9-debt-interest.csv\n  [11]: mailto:better.info@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

      "markdown": "One of the most contested aspects of the EU Referendum debate has been the potential impact on trade between the UK and the rest of the EU.\n\nSo, what can ONS statistics tell us about the importance of trade with and beyond the EU for the UK? This article is part of a series of [UK Perspectives][1], on topics such as the economy and housing, as well as two new articles; this one and another on contributions to the EU budget.\n\n\n###Q. How important is the EU to UK trade?\nThe EU is a large market for the UK, particularly for our exports of services and goods, including components and fuels.\n\nIn 2015, 44% of the UK's goods and services were exported to the EU, while 53% of our imports came to the UK from the EU.\n\nIn the same year, UK exports to the EU were valued at £223.3 billion, while UK imports from the EU stood at £291.1 billion.\n\nFor countries outside the EU, UK exports that year were valued at £288.2 billion, while imports were worth £257.1 billion.\n\n####UK exports (goods and services) with EU and Non-EU countries, current prices, 1999 to 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc329/exports/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK exports (goods and services) with EU and Non-EU countries, current prices, 1999 to 2015\"/>\n[Download the data][2].\n\n\n\n\n\nThe percentage of the UK’s imports from the EU has remained largely stable over the last 16 years.\n\n####UK imports (goods and services) with EU and Non-EU countries, current prices, 1999 to 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc329/imports/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK imports (goods and services) with EU and Non-EU countries, current prices, 1999 to 2015\"/>\n[Download the data][3].\n\n\n\nUK exports to the EU have risen by 68% between 1999 and 2015 (when relevant trade statistics were first collected), while imports have risen by 101% (these figures are in current prices, so not adjusting for inflation).\n\n###Q. Who does the UK trade with in the EU and beyond the EU?\nBetween 2012 to 2014  an average of slightly more than 50% of the UK’s exports of goods went to the EU and just under 50% to non-EU territories, primarily the USA and China.\n\nLast year, goods exports to non-EU countries pulled ahead, with a 53% share of the total.\n\nIn 2014, the United States was the country with the single largest share of UK exports of goods and services, but seven of the UK's main trading partners are from within the EU (Germany, Netherlands, France, Ireland, Belgium and Luxembourg (combined), Italy and Spain).\n\nIn 2015, 11% of the UK’s exports of goods went to Germany, compared with 17% to the US, while 15% of imports of goods came from Germany, compared with 9% from the US.\n\nThe UK has increasingly been trading with emerging and advanced economies from outside the EU, with the proportion of trade with EU countries falling since 1999.\n\n####UK top 10 trading partners in goods and services, current prices, 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc329/slope%20chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK top 10 trading partners in goods and services, current prices, 2014\"/>\n[Download the data][4].\n\nBusiness services and finance form about a third of the UK economy, which is a factor driving the UK’s surplus in services.\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">\n**What is the balance of trade?**<br/>\nThe UK runs a trade deficit in goods and a trade surplus in services with the EU.\n\nThe UK exports more in services than it imports, which means it runs a trade surplus for services. This is because the UK economy is now dominated by the service sector, rather than manufacturing and other production.\n\nWhen we look at the UK’s trade in goods, however, we find that we import more than we export, which means we run a trade deficit for goods.\n\nThe surplus in the trade in services does not make up for the trade deficit in goods, so overall, the trade balance is in deficit\n</ons-box>\n\nIn 2014, the USA was the UK’s largest trading partner in services accounting for 23% of total UK exports of services and 18% of UK service imports. However, as with trade in goods, more than half of the UK’s top 10 trading partners in services are EU countries, with Germany, Netherlands, Spain and France dominating.\n\nWithin the EU, the UK exports the majority of its goods and services to a handful of countries - Germany, France, Ireland and the Netherlands.\n\nThis is partly because:\n\n- France and Germany are large economies and geographically close to the UK\n- Germany is an EU manufacturing hub that uses UK components\n- There are historical trade links with Ireland, and a common language\n- The Netherlands is a global gateway, through the port of Rotterdam, that acts as an intermediate destination for trade between the UK and other countries. This is known as the Rotterdam effect.[^1^](#footnote1) It’s also an important financial and business services trading centre.\n\nThe UK is also an important part of the EU supply chain, as a relatively high proportion of our exports of goods are components manufactured in the UK for onward assembly elsewhere in the EU.\n\nFor example, Airbus aeroplane wings are manufactured in the UK for export and onward assembly in other parts of Europe.\n\nThe UK tends to export more components, fuels, food and beverages, and basic materials to the EU than non-EU countries, but export more finished goods and services to non-EU countries than to the EU.\n\n###Q. How important is UK trade to the rest of the EU?\nWhile the EU market is an important destination for the UK’s exports and an important source of UK imports, the UK is a smaller player in terms of significance to the EU.\n\nThis is partly because the EU is such a large market that any one destination for exports or source of imports will be relatively small compared to the total.\n\nThe EU accounts for almost half of the UK’s exports, reflecting the fact it is such a large market, comprised of 27 other countries.\n\nHowever, the UK, as one of many trading partners, accounts for 4%-5% of all other EU countries’ imports – the other side of the UK’s EU export relationship.\n\nThe UK is also a relatively small export destination for EU goods, accounting for 6%-7% of total exports of other EU countries over the past eight years.[^2^](#footnote2)\n\nThe share of EU exports going to the UK has been gradually declining over the past 15 years, but it has risen marginally in the last four years. This may partly be due to strong growth in the UK economy or the strength of the pound against the euro in recent years, both of which may have led to higher UK imports.\n\n####UK share of EU trade in goods, 2000 to 2015[^3^](#footnote3)\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc329/Trade%20charts/chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK share of EU trade in goods, 2000 to 2015\"/>[Download the data][6].\n\nThe UK’s importance as an export market for the EU varies across member states, with Ireland and some of the smaller member states having higher export shares to the UK than the bigger, more prominent EU member states, such as Germany, France, Spain and Italy.\n\n####UK share of select EU country exports of goods, 5 year average (2011 to 2015)\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc329/Trade%20charts/chart5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK share of select EU country exports of goods, 5 year average (2011 to 2015)\"/>[Download the data][7].\n\nThe higher proportion of exports from Ireland is in part due to historical and cultural links, and geographic proximity.\n\nIt is worth noting that although the share of exports going to the UK is similar for Germany, France, Spain and Italy, compared to some of the other smaller members states in the chart, 6% of Germany’s exports to the UK will be a much higher level in terms of value, than 6% of Sweden’s exports.\n\n###Q. How important is trade for the UK economy?\nThe UK buys and sells goods and services across the world, in the form of imports and exports.\n\nAccessing markets beyond our shores helps the economy to grow and supports living standards. The UK is able to sell its goods overseas and in return can purchase goods that might be relatively cheaper, better quality, or offer a wider range of choice.\n\nExports in 2015 made up for 27% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), whereas imports are equivalent to around 29% of the UK’s GDP.\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">\n**What is GDP?**<br/>\nGDP (Gross Domestic Product) represents the total value in £s of a country’s goods and services in a given period of time. It’s a way of measuring how well the economy is doing.\n</ons-box>\n\n####Imports and exports as % of GDP over time\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc329/Trade%20charts/chart6/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Imports and exports as % of GDP over time\"/>\n[Download the data][8].\n###Q. What about investment into the UK or abroad?\nAs well as trading with other parts of the world, companies also invest overseas.\n\nThis is known as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and comes in the form of:\n\n- Outward investment - by UK nationals and companies in overseas countries.\n- Inward investment - by foreign nationals and companies into the UK.\n\nIn simple terms, FDI can attract investment into the UK economy from overseas, while also providing UK investors with market opportunities elsewhere.\n\nIn 2014 38% of the total UK overseas investment stock (FDI), was in EU countries, whereas 25% was in North America. ([ONS, 2016b][9]).\n\nThe EU is also the largest investor in the UK in terms of FDI, accounting for 44% of total investment (FDI), followed by North America which accounted for 25%.\n\n\n\nWe would value your feedback on this article - please complete our [short survey. ][10]\n\n\n\nNotes:\nThis piece illustrates and explains some of the more high-level aspects of the EU trade debate, but does not seek to explain some of the wider aspects of, for example, strategic or trade negotiation arguments, or the impact of trade on jobs, inflation, growth and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/?p=7837&preview=true\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Chart-1-Exports.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Chart-2-Imports.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Chart-3-Slope.csv\n  [5]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/uktrade/uk-trade/december-2014/sty-trade-rotterdam-effect-.html\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Chart-4-Exports-and-imports-1.csv\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Chart-5-EU-members.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Chart-6-of-GDP.csv\n  [9]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/articles/ananalysisofforeigndirectinvestmentthemaindriveroftherecentdeteriorationintheukscurrentaccount/january2016\n  [10]: https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/PF5QWBC\n  [11]: mailto:trade.in.goods@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n<h6 id=\"footnote1\">1.</h6>The Rotterdam effect: It has been argued that the pattern of trade between the UK and other countries has been distorted by the location of big international ports such as Rotterdam.The Rotterdam effect is the situation where goods which are initially exported to one country are then re-exported somewhere else.<br/><br/>\nAn [ONS article][5] estimated that 50 per cent of all goods exports to the Netherlands were re-exported to non-EU countries.It also estimated that the Rotterdam effect would account for around four percentage points of the UK’s exports of goods.

      "markdown": "Spending by the UK Government currently accounts for around 41% of GDP. The way public funds are allocated impacts the provision and delivery of services (like health, pensions and benefits), and therefore affects people’s day to day lives.\n\nThis article in the [UK Perspectives series][1] presents key statistics showing changes in government spending over the last two decades, and takes a closer look at some aspects of the largest spending categories.\n###1. Changes in public spending over time\n####Total UK government managed spending (in 2014/15 real terms) and government managed spending as % of GDP, financial year ending 1995 to financial year ending 2015[^1^](#footnote1)\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc337/Public_Chart1/Public_Chart1.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Changes in public spending over time\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][2]\n\n<svg height=\"150\" width=\"100%\">\n<text x=\"0\" y=\"60\" font-size=\"80\" font-family=\"Open Sans\" font-weight=\"bold\">£747 billion</text>\n<text x=\"0\" y=\"105\" font-size=\"16\" font-family=\"Open Sans\">Total government spending</text>\n<text x=\"0\" y=\"130\" font-size=\"12\" font-family=\"Open Sans\">Financial year ending 2015</text>\n</svg>\n\n- After more than a decade of continuous growth, total government spending (in 2014/15 real terms) reached a high of £765.2 billion in 2010/11.\n- In 2014/15 government spending was £746.7 billion; this was £1.1 billion higher than 2013/14 in real terms.\n- Since 2009/10, government spending as a percentage of GDP has fallen from 46.1% to 40.8% in 2014/15.\n\n###2. Share of spending on health has increased over last 20 years\n####Proportions of total UK government spending by function (in 2014/15 real terms), £billions (and as a percentage of total) financial year ending 1995 and financial year ending 2015[^2^](#footnote2)\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc337/Public_Chart2/Public_Chart2.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Share in spending on health has increased in the last 20 years\"/>\n[Download the data][3].\n\nSince 1994/95 the top three spending categories have been social protection, health and education\n\nHealth spending increased steadily and had the largest increase proportionally, increasing from 13.9% of all government spending in 1994/95 to 19.8% in 2014/15.\n\nSocial protection (pensions, benefits and personal social services) spending was the largest public spending category, totalling £258.4 billion in 2014/15 compared with £162.6 billion in 1994/95 (2014-15 real terms). This represented 38.1% of total government spending in 2014/15, compared with 35.9% in 1994/95.\n\nEducation was the 3rd largest area of government spending; proportionately this has fallen slightly compared with 20 years ago. Education spending was 12.5% of total government spending in 2014/15 and 12.7% in 1994/95.\n\nOver the same period spending on defence fell from 8.2% to 5.4% of the total. Spending on public order and safety, which includes policing and crime prevention, fell from 5.5% to 4.4%.\n###3. Pensions spending increased over last 5 years\n####Proportions of UK social protection spending by category (in real terms), financial year ending 2010 and financial year ending 2014[^3^](#footnote3)\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc337/Public_Chart3/Public_Chart3.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Share in spending on health has increased in the last 20 years\"/>\n[Download the data.][4]\n\n<svg height=\"150\" width=\"100%\">\n<text x=\"0\" y=\"60\" font-size=\"80\" font-family=\"Open Sans\" font-weight=\"bold\">£258 billion</text>\n<text x=\"0\" y=\"105\" font-size=\"16\" font-family=\"Open Sans\">Social protection spending spending</text>\n<text x=\"0\" y=\"130\" font-size=\"12\" font-family=\"Open Sans\">Financial year ending 2015</text>\n</svg>\n\nPensions were the largest component of social protection spending in 2014/15 and their share has increased over the last 5 years. It was 37.9% in 2010/11 and 41.9% in 2014/15, when total spending on pensions was £108 billion. Increased spending on pensions in particular reflects the UK’s growing and ageing population and the fact pensions have been rising faster than inflation. [Forecasts][5] have projected that spending on state pensions will increase from 5.5% of GDP in 2014/15 to 7.0% of GDP by 2054/55.\n\nGovernment policies on the state pension age affect the number of people who qualify for a state pension and, therefore, will also affect the overall level of spending on pensions that is required.\n\nThe share of spending on family benefits, income support and tax credits has fallen the most over the same period. It was 20.3% in 2010/11 and was 17.2% in 2014/15.\n###4. Secondary education made up largest share of education spending\n####UK spending on four education categories, financial year ending 2011 to financial year ending 2015[^4^](#footnote4)\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc337/Public_Chart5/Public_Chart5.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportional spending on education\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][6]\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Spending on education at all levels includes: operation and support of schools, administration and inspections.</ons-box>\n\nSecondary education accounted for £36.8 billion of spending on education in 2014/15, or 44% of the total.  Primary education accounted for £26.0 billion, 31% of the total, and education for the under fives accounted for £5.2 billion, 6% of the total. Spending on these three categories has remained similar since 2010/11.\n\nSpending on higher (tertiary) education in 2014/15 was £10.3 billion, 12% of the total. This has fluctuated from year to year. However, this is mainly because each year’s figure takes account of changes in the estimated value of future student loan repayments, rather than simply how much cash is actually spent.\n###5. Majority of defence expenditure is on equipment and property\n####Proportion of UK defence spending by category, financial year ending 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc337/Public_Chart6/Public_Chart6/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of UK defence spending by category, financial year ending 2015\"/>\n[Download the data.][7]\n\nIn 2014/15 the majority of defence spending was on equipment and property (59%). This spending includes new military machinery, maintenance of existing equipment, property, dual use equipment and research & development. The proportion of spending on equipment and property has increased from 56% in 2011/12.\n\nGovernment spending on defence services also includes the costs of employing armed forces and civilian personnel. In 2014/15 around 32% of expenditure was on armed forces and civilian personnel costs, including pay and allowances, and this has fallen from almost 35% in 2011/12. The average strength of the [armed forces][8] and [civilian][9] personnel during 2014/15 was 251,670, a fall of 13% from 1 April 2012.\n\nThe remaining 9% of expenditure was on running cost items such as stores, fuel, clothing and other materials such as stationery.\n###Conclusion: Public spending reflects changing demands\nThere have been some large changes to the amount of government spending on different types of public service in the last 20 years. In particular, spending on health and pensions has played an increasingly important role over time as the UK’s population increases and gets older.\n\nChanges in government spending can be driven by requirements for public services like healthcare and pensions, as well as by policies initiated by government. In the future, the changing needs of the country’s population will help determine how public money is spent.\n\n\n\n####Notes\nPlease note that wherever slashes \"/\" are used between years it relates to financial years, for example wherever 2014/15 is used it refers to the financial year ending 2015.\n\n####For more information, contact: better.info@ons.gov.uk\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/introducing-uk-perspectives-2016\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Table1-Total-Managed-Expenditure.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Table2-Spending-by-function_-1.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Table3-social-protection.csv\n  [5]: http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/download/fiscal-sustainability-report-june-2015/\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Table5-education-billions.csv\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Table6-Military-spending-v2.csv\n  [8]: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-armed-forces-monthly-service-personnel-statistics-index\n  [9]: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/mod-civilian-personnel-quarterly-statistics-index\n\n####Footnotes:\n<h6 id=\"footnote1\">1.</h6>Real terms figures based on ONS GDP data as of 31 March 2016.\n<h6 id=\"footnote2\">2.</h6>Figures do not include accounting adjustments.\n<h6 id=\"footnote3\">3.</h6>The level of detail required for the United Nations Classification of the Functions of Government is not yet available in England and Wales.

      "markdown": "There are many different factors that affect our standard of living but a key aspect is our financial situation, in particular levels of personal and household income, wealth and spending.\n\nThis article is part of a series of [UK Perspectives][1] providing an overview of the social and economic changes of the nation over the last three decades. It presents some key statistics relating to personal and household finances.\n###1. The trend of rising household income has levelled off since 2007\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Real Household Disposable Income (RHDI) is the total amount of money that households have available after direct taxes (such as income tax and council tax) have been paid, with an adjustment for inflation to allow for comparisons over time.</ons-box>\n####Real Gross Household (only) Disposable Income (RHDI) per head, UK, 1997 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc338/Finance_Chart1/Finance_Chart1.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Real Gross Household (only) Disposable Income (RHDI) per head, UK, 1997 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data][2].\n\nThis chart uses RHDI per head for households only (excluding non-profit institutions serving households[^1^](#footnote1), now considered a better indicator of the economic well-being of households. It shows that RHDI per person (households only) steadily increased between 1997 and 2007, but has changed little since then. In 2015 RHDI per head (households only) was £17,456.\n###2. Differences in household incomes have grown since 1980\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The median equivalised household disposable income is the income of the middle household if all households in the UK were listed from poorest to richest. This means it provides a good indication of the standard of living of a 'typical' household. Households are ranked by their equivalised disposable income which is the process of accounting for the fact that households with many members are likely to need a higher income to achieve the same standard of living as households with fewer members.</ons-box>\n####Median equivalised household disposable income[^2^](#footnote2), UK, 1977 to financial year ending 2015[^3^](#footnote3)\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc338/Finance_Chart2/Finance_Chart2.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Real equivalised household disposable income of UK households, 1980-2012/13\"/>\n[Download the data.][3]\n\nSince 1977 income levels for all households have generally been rising (after accounting for inflation) but this has been accompanied by an increase in income inequality. In terms of disposable income, the richest fifth of households have seen the greatest percentage increase in their incomes, while incomes for the poorest fifth have increased at a slower rate.\n\nSince 2008 there has been comparatively little change in the figures. In the financial year 2014/15 median household income was £25,660, very similar to the peak of £25,683 in 2007/08. Average income of the poorest fifth of households in 2014/15 was £12,870, comparable with the peak of £12,895 in 2009/10. Average income of the richest fifth of households was £54,233 in 2014/15; this was 3% lower than the peak of £56,026 in 2007/08.\n\n###3. The percentage of people living in relative low income has been falling over time\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Households with income below 60% of the median UK household income in the year the data is collected are considered to be living in relative low income in that year.</ons-box>\n####Percentage of people living in relative low income, UK, financial year ending 1999 to financial year ending 2014 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc338/Finance_Chart3/Finance_Chart3.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of people living in relative low income, UK, financial year ending 1999 to financial year ending 2014Â�\"/>\n[Download the data.][4]\n\n_Note: The preferred measure of relative low income for pensioners is on an “after housing costs” basis. In this chart, however, “before housing costs” has been used to allow comparison with other age groups. All data are equivalised._\n\n17% of children (2.3 million) in the UK were living in relative low income in the financial year 2013/14. This is a fall from 26% (or 3.4 million children) in 1998/99.\n\nUsing the same 'before housing costs' measure, 16% of pensioners (1.9 million) in the UK were living in relative low income in 2013/14, a fall from 27% in 1998/99. However, using the preferred 'after housing costs' measure, 14% of pensioners (1.6 million) were living in relatively low income in 2013/14, compared with 29% in 1998/99. The figure is lower using this measure because pensioners tend to have lower housing costs than other groups.\n\nFinally, 14% of all working-age adults (5.4 million) in the UK were living in relative low income in 2013/14. This has changed little since 1998/99.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that falls in the number and percentage of people living in relative low income up to 2013/14 in part reflects falls in median income since 2009/10. This means the relative low income threshold, which is based on 60% of median income, also fell. Therefore these reductions do not entirely reflect an increase in the standard of living.\n\n###4. The cost of living: how does the growth in pay compare to inflation?\nHere we compare the growth in regular pay[^4^](#footnote4) with the growth in the price level (the rate of inflation).\n\nWe use the growth in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) to represent the rate of inflation as this is the headline measure of inflation in the UK[^5^](#footnote5)\n\n####Annual growth rates in average weekly regular pay in Great Britain and the UK Consumer Prices Index (CPI), 2001 to 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc338/Finance_Chart4/Finance_Chart4.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Annual growth rates in average weekly regular pay in Great Britain and the UK Consumer Prices Index (CPI), 2001 to 2016\"/>\n[Download the data.][5]\n\nHistorically the annual growth in average weekly regular pay has tended to be higher than the inflation rate. However from late 2009 to mid-2014 the inflation rate was above the annual change in average weekly regular pay in Great Britain.\n\nMore recent data has shown the annual change in average weekly regular pay exceeding the inflation rate leading to a 'real' increase in wages. This has been partly because of a higher annual growth rate of the average weekly regular pay and partly because of falls in the inflation rate.\n\n###5. Household spending decreased between 2006 and 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc338/Finance_Chart5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Interactive chart - UK in a European context\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][6]\n\nUK households spent £531.30 on average per week in 2014. However, when taking inflation into account, average spending has actually decreased since 2006 – when households spent £547.00. The largest single area of spending in 2014 was on transport at £74.80 a week.\n\n###6. Household energy spending and fuel poverty\nIn 2014, the poorest fifth of UK households spent 11% (£88 a month) of their disposable income on household energy. This compares with the richest fifth for whom the figure was 2% (£144 a month). For both groups this was a reduced proportion compared with 2013 but in general their proportion of disposable income spent on household energy has increased over the past decade.\n\nSince 2004, domestic energy prices in the UK have generally risen in price by more than the rate of inflation (as measured by the CPI). In 2015, however, there was a fall in energy prices, mainly caused by a fall in the price of gas.[^6^](#footnote6)\n\n####Percentage of household disposable income[^7^](#footnote7), spent on energy[^8^](#footnote8), UK, financial year ending 2002 to 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc338/Finance_Chart6/Finance_Chart6.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Disposable income spent on energy increases over time\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">A household is said to be fuel poor, and therefore experiencing fuel poverty if it needs to spend more than 10% of its income on fuel to maintain an adequate level of warmth (usually defined as 21 degrees for the main living area, and 18 degrees for other occupied rooms). This is referred to as the '10% definition'.</ons-box>\n\nThe number of fuel poor households in the UK in 2013 was estimated at around 4.5 million, representing around 17% of all UK households[^9^](#footnote9). Fuel poverty varies over time dependent on incomes, fuel prices and energy use. Between 2003 and 2013 the number of households in fuel poverty increased at a time of energy price rises. Prior to this, between 1996 and 2003, fuel poverty had decreased as energy prices fell.[^10^](#footnote10)\n\nOverall there has been a fall in the consumption of both gas and electricity since 2005. This is in part due to rising prices and the impact of energy efficiency policies.[^11^](#footnote11)\n\n###7. Total household net wealth has increased overall but there is an unequal distribution across Great Britain[^12^](#footnote12)\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Total net household wealth is defined as the sum of net property wealth (the difference between the value of owned property and the amount owed on it), physical wealth (assets such as cars, art, antiques etc), net financial wealth (the value of savings and investments minus any debts), and private pension wealth.</ons-box>\n\nTotal net household wealth aggregated across all households in Great Britain in the period July 2012 to June 2014 was £11.1 trillion.\n\n- The largest elements of this were private pension wealth (40%) and net property wealth (35%).\n- 45% of the £11.1 trillion was owned by the wealthiest 10% of households, while 9% of the £11.1 trillion was owned by the least wealthy 50% of households.\n- This figure has increased from £9.5 trillion in the period July 2010 to June 2012 and £9 trillion in the period July 2008 to June 2010 (not adjusting for inflation).\n- Half of all households in the period July 2012 to June 2014 had total net household wealth of £225,100 or more.\n\n###Conclusion\nOverall, levels of income have risen since 1980, but the gap between the richest and poorest fifth of households has widened.\n\nIn recent years the percentage of the household population living in relative low income has fallen. In addition there has been a decrease in household spending after inflation is taken into account. This may be related to the growth in pay being below the inflation rate since the economic downturn, until more recently when an unusually low inflation rate has reversed this situation.\n\n####For more information, contact: [better.info@ons.gov.uk](mailto:betterinfo@ons.gov.uk)\n\n###Footnotes:\n<h6 id=\"footnote1\">1.</h6>Historically, estimates of RHDI from the UK economic accounts comprised two sectors: the household sector and the non-profit institutions serving households sector (NPISH). NPISH mainly comprises charities and universities, but also includes entities like trade unions and political parties. More recently, to enable a better understanding of the well-being of households alone, NPISH components have been separated from RHDI. This provides a household only estimate which is presented here. \n<h6 id=\"footnote2\">2.</h6>All income figures are deflated using the household final consumption expenditure implied deflator.

      "markdown": "The UK housing market comprises 28.1 million residential properties in 2014[^1^](#footnote1). Linked to income, wealth and availability of lending, the housing market is sensitive to the overall economic climate.\n\n\n\nHousing policy in the UK is devolved and sub national trends are available in the related links. This article in the [UK Perspectives][2] series presents some UK national trends.\n###1. Current rising house prices\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The ONS mix-adjusted House Price Index (HPI) is a measure of house price inflation over time and is calculated as a weighted average of prices for a standard mix of tenure. This removes the effect of the changing composition of properties.</ons-box>\n\n####Mix-adjusted House Price Index (HPI), UK, 1980 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc336/House_Chart1/House_Chart1.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Mix-adjusted House Price Index (HPI), UK, 1980 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3].\n\n- On average house prices have increased by 7% per year since 1980.\n- Since 1980, the greatest annual increase in house prices was 25.6% in 1988.\n- In 2015, the average price (mix adjusted) of a property in the UK stood at £279,000.\n\nThere were seven years between 1980 and 2013 where, on average, UK house prices fell - the majority of which occurred during the recession of the early 1990s. The biggest drop, however, was 7.6% in 2009.\n\nThe economic downturn in 2008 had a considerable impact on the UK housing market. The decline in house prices was accompanied by reduced mortgage availability and stricter lending criteria.\n\nThe number of property sales in the UK almost halved from a peak of 1.67 million in 2006 to 0.85 million in 2009[^2^](#footnote2). Since 2009, however, the number of sales has partially recovered – increasing to 1.23 million in 2015[^3^](#footnote3).\n###2. Declining number of first time buyers\n####Number of mortgage loans for first time buyers, UK, 1980 to 2015[^4^](#footnote4)\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc336/House_Chart2/House_Chart2.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Number of mortgage loans to first time buyers\"/>\n\nRising house prices could partially explain the decline in the number of first time buyers taking out a mortgage, although other economic factors will play a role. From the 1980s until the early 2000s there were typically between 400,000 and 600,000 loans to first time buyers each year. However, in 2003 there was a 31% decline and then in 2008 there was a further 47% decrease – the largest in the series – as the economic downturn affected the housing market.\n\nIn recent years the number of first time buyers has been recovering, although numbers fell in 2015 and the levels remain below those seen before 2003.\n###3. Decreasing numbers of younger homeowners\n####Percentage of each age group that are home owners[^5^](#footnote5), England, 1981 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc336/House_Chart3/House_Chart3.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Home owners by age group\"/>\n\n[Download the data][5].\n\nThe reduction in the numbers of first time buyers has subsequently had an impact on the age of homeowners. In 1991, 67% of the 25 to 34 age group were homeowners. By the financial year ending 2014, this had declined to 36%.[^6^](#footnote6)\n\nThere were also reductions in home ownership over the same period for the 16 to 24 age group (from 36% to 9%) and for the 35 to 44 age group (from 78% to 59%). By contrast, home ownership has increased among older age groups.\n###4. Deposits paid by first time buyers\n####Deposit as a percentage of purchase price by type of buyer, UK, 1988 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc336/House_Chart4/House_Chart4.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Deposit as a percentage of purchase price by type of buyer, UK, 1988 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data][7].\n\nAnother changing aspect of the housing market is the percentage of purchase price being paid as a deposit. For first time buyers the average deposit as a percentage of purchase price more than doubled between 1988 and the peak of the economic downturn in 2009, reaching almost 28% of the price of the house. A likely factor was that buyers with smaller deposits became less likely to be approved for a mortgage, pushing up the average value of those deposits that were paid.\n\nSince then, deposits for first time buyers have fallen as a percentage of purchase price, although the 2015 figure of 21% is still much higher than it was through the late 1980s, the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nFor existing owner occupiers the level of deposit being paid has been more stable, but also peaked during the economic downturn in 2009. Since then the level has fallen from 39% to 35%, which is similar to the level in the late 1980s. The difference in percentage deposit paid by first time buyers and existing owners has therefore narrowed over time.\n\n###5. Increase in private rental sector stock\nThe number of households in the UK, and therefore demand for housing, has increased, partly as a result of increasing population together with decreasing average household size. There were 27 million households in the UK in 2015. Of these, 29% consisted of only one person[^7^](#footnote7); in 1981, 20% of the 20.2 million households were single occupancy[^8^](#footnote8).\n\n####Dwelling stock by tenure, UK, 1980 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc336/House_Chart5/House_Chart5.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Dwelling stock by tenure, UK, 1980 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data][10].\n\nSupply has also risen, with an increase of 31% in the total dwelling stock between 1980 and 2014.\n\nUnder the 1988 Large Scale Voluntary Transfer (LSVT) policy, local authorities transferred much of their housing stock to housing associations and registered social landlords.\n\nMeanwhile, the growth of home ownership throughout the 1980s and 1990s can be partly attributed to the introduction of [Right to Buy][11], a policy in the UK which provides secure tenants of [councils][12] and some [housing associations][13] the [legal right][14] to purchase the home they are living in at a large discount. By 1991, more than one million council houses in England had been sold to their tenants as a result[^9^](#footnote9).\n\nThe rate of Right to Buy sales fell during the 1990s, and in recent years the number of owner occupancies has also slightly declined. Accompanying this decline is the continued growth of private sector renting – which more than doubled between 1980 and 2014.\n###6. Fewer new homes are being built\n####Permanent dwellings completed, by tenure, UK, financial year ending 1980 to financial year ending 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc336/House_Chart6/House_Chart6.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Permanent dwellings completed, by tenure, UK, financial year ending 1980 to financial year ending 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data][16].\n\nThe overall level of house building in the UK has declined since 1980, with 152,440 houses built in the financial year ending 2015 – a fall of nearly 40% from the 251,820 built in the financial year ending 1980.\n\nFrom the financial year ending 2003, the number of build completions saw a short term increase, peaking in the financial year ending 2007. Afterwards, the number of houses built dropped at the time of the economic downturn, although since the financial year ending 2013 build completions have again increased.\n##Conclusion: Increasing demand and limited supply\nSince 1980, there has been considerable fluctuation in the UK housing market. Overall, there has been growing demand and relatively limited supply growth. House prices have been increasing, and first time buyers are finding it more difficult to get on the property ladder – while home ownership among younger age groups generally has declined. As the UK population continues to grow, housing is likely to remain an important topic in the future.\n\nFor more information, contact: [digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk][17]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-dwelling-stock-including-vacants\n  [2]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/introducing-uk-perspectives-2016\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Housing_Chart1.csv\n  [4]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/492847/uk_tables_jan_2016__cir_.pdf\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Housing_Chart3-v2.csv\n  [6]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-housing-survey-2014-to-2015-headline-report\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Housing_Chart4-1.csv\n  [8]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/bulletins/familiesandhouseholds/2015-11-05\n  [9]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/social-trends-rd/social-trends/social-trends-41/social-trends-41---household-and-families.pdf\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Housing_Chart5-v2.csv\n  [11]: https://righttobuy.gov.uk/\n  [12]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_house\n  [13]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_association\n  [14]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_right\n  [15]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-social-housing-sales#right-to-buy-sales\n  [16]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Housing_Chart6.csv\n  [17]: mailto:better.info@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n<h6 id=\"footnote1\">1.</h6> [Dwelling stock in the UK][1]\n<h6 id=\"footnote2\">2.</h6> See table 5 of the [data][4].

      "markdown": "In 2014 the Government spent [£798 billion ][1]but an area of spending that has been of particular interest is the money the UK pays to the European Union (EU).\n\n\nThis has been an ever present topic in the debate over whether or not the UK should remain a member of the EU, so here we take a closer look at the figures.\n\nHowever, before we do, please note that none of the figures on the money flowing between the UK and EU are fully reflective of the total costs and benefits of EU membership as these are complex and difficult to quantify.\n\nThis article is part of a series of [UK Perspectives][2], on topics such as the economy and housing, as well as two new articles; this one and another on UK trade within the EU and beyond.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc332/share%20of%20budget/stackedbar/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK Contributions to the EU\"/>\n\n\n###Making meaning of large amounts\n\nOften, very large numbers can lose meaning - to help you make sense of them we have created a calculator tool that will break the numbers down for you.\n\n\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc332/calculator/content.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Context Calculator\"/>\n\n\n###The UK contribution over time \n\nThe UK’s contribution to the EU budget changes each year as it is dependent on various factors such as: UK Gross National Income (GNI), the GNI of other EU member states and the value of the UK rebate (which is not a fixed amount, rather it is based on payments and receipts for the previous year). Here, using ONS figures we take a look at how the UK contribution has changed over the past five years.\n\n####UK contributions to the EU budget, 2010 to 2014 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc332/timeseries/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK contributions to the EU budget, 2010 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][3]\n\n###2015 estimates\n\nThere are estimates available for the UK’s net contribution in 2015. These are initial estimates because our payments for each year are based on forecasts of our economic output and other factors, which are adjusted once actual data is collected. These calculations have not yet been completed for 2015 so the figures should be treated as approximate and likely to be subject to revision.\n\nA 2015 initial figure used by some commentators in the debate is the £8.5 billion estimate of the UK’s 2015 contribution (which is net of the rebate and the direct payments from the EU to the public sector). This initial estimate is from the Office for Budget Responsibility and published in [this document][4] from the Treasury.\n\nAnother estimate can be found in table H of this [ONS release][5] which includes some information on the UK’s official transactions with the EU in 2015. The figure published here is £10.6 billion; however, the information used to calculate this figure is approximate and does not give the same level of detail on UK transactions with the EU as Table 9.9 of ONS’s [Pink Book][6]. The next Pink Book will be published on 29 July 2016.\n\n###Other Pink Book figures\n\nSome commentators have previously [quoted figures][7] calculated from table 9.2 of the Pink Book. [In an official letter][8] written by the Deputy National Statistician for Economic Statistics, Jonathan Athow it is stated that “The information set down in table 9.2 of the Pink Book on the current account position does not give a full picture of the UK’s position with respect to  the EU . . . We would therefore discourage users from using the figures in table 9.2 as a reflection of the UK’s contribution to the EU.”\n\n####Notes:\n\nIn the calendar year 2014, total general government expenditure was £798 billion. Here we have used a wide definition, which includes spending on healthcare, education, defence etc and also includes spending on social security benefits. Central Government spending and Local Government spending are both included. The amount covers the whole of the UK.\n\nThe Treasury also [publishes figures][10] on the payments between the EU and the UK government. Their figures are very similar to those reported by the ONS as both use essentially the same data but due to some accounting differences there are some relatively small differences between the figures - for example the Treasury estimates the UK's net contribution to the EU in 2014 as £9.8 billion.\n\nEuropean Commission figures are from the data download in their [2014 financial report][11] and have been converted into sterling using exchange rate data from Bloomberg.\n\nSome commentators also draw attention to the fact that a certain amount of the UK’s contribution to the EU budget goes towards our target for overseas aid spending. [They argue][12] that if we were to leave the EU, the UK would still be committed to this spending, so this money would not be saved. In 2014 it was estimated that [£0.8 billion][13] of our EU contribution counted towards our overseas aid spending target.\n\nThe European Commission figures account for all payments it receives from the UK Government and payments it makes to the UK public and private sector bodies. A small proportion of spending - just over 2% - cannot be allocated to a specific country and so are not included in the Commission's figures. There are also some payments to the Commission that are not allocated to a particular country and therefore are also not included in their figures. An example of this is fines, which is again a small proportion of total spending, typically between 2 and 3 % of total expenditure.\n\n\n\nFor more information, contact: [digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk][14]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicspending/datasets/esatable11annualexpenditureofgeneralgovernment\n  [2]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/introducing-uk-perspectives-2016/\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Data-Download-for-UK-contributions-over-time-with-years.csv\n  [4]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/483344/EU_finances_2015_final_web_09122015.pdf\n  [5]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/balanceofpayments/octtodecandannual2015\n  [6]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/compendium/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/2015-10-30\n  [7]: http://www.voteleavetakecontrol.org/campaign\n  [8]: https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/economic-statistics/\n  [9]: https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/PNRHWBT\n  [10]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/483344/EU_finances_2015_final_web_09122015.pdf\n  [11]: http://ec.europa.eu/budget/financialreport/2014/management/index_en.html\n  [12]: http://infacts.org/briefings/eu-budget/\n  [13]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statistics-on-international-development-2015\n  [14]: http://better.info@ons.gov.uk\n"

      "markdown": "Climate change and sustainable energy have generated an increasing amount of  media, public and political debate in the UK during recent years.\n\nThis article, part of a series of UK Perspectives, provides an overview of the nation over the last two decades, presenting some key statistics relating to national energy and emissions trends.\n\n###1. Transport is the UK’s biggest energy consumer\n####Energy consumption by final user^1^ (energy supplied basis) for the industry, transport and domestic sectors, UK, 1980 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc339/Energy_Chart1/Energy_Chart1.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Energy consumption by final user^1^ (energy supplied basis) for the industry, transport and domestic sectors, UK, 1980 to 2015\"/>\n\nIn 1988, transport became, and remained, the largest energy consumer. In 2015, it accounted for more than a third (40%) of total energy consumption – compared to a quarter (25%) in 1980.\n\nIn contrast, industry – accounting for the largest share (34%) of the UK’s total energy consumption in 1980 – had fallen to 17% by 2015. This is in line with its reduced UK economic share, combined with industrial processes becoming more energy efficient.\n\nDespite the increase in the number of UK households over time, domestic consumption has remained relatively constant – likely a result of improved energy efficiency. However, since the main driver of domestic energy consumption is heating, year on year fluctuations have generally occurred in accordance with seasonal weather conditions.\n\nTotal UK energy consumption^2^ was highest from 2000 to 2005 at around 160,000 kilotonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe) per year.  In recent years consumption has fallen and by 2015 was 135,000 ktoe, similar to levels seen in the early 1980s.\n\n###2. The UK imports over one third of its energy supply\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Net import dependency is the proportion of the UK’s energy supply that comes from imports. It is calculated by dividing net energy imports (imports minus exports) by the total amount of energy used.</ons-box>\n \n####Energy import dependency, UK, 1980 to 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc339/Energy_Chart2/Energy_Chart2.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Energy import dependency, UK, 1980 to 2015\"/>\n\nA number of factors determine the amount of energy the UK imports, including energy consumption, production and the price of imports compared with the price of domestic production.\n\nIn 2015, the UK imported more energy than it exported – with an import dependency level of 39%. This meant over one third of the UK’s net energy supply came from imports. The UK’s import dependency has fallen from 46% in 2014. This decrease was due to a rise in exports and fall in imports with fossil fuel dependency at a record low in 2015.\n\nThe UK’s dependency on energy imports has fluctuated over time. In the early 1980s, the UK became a net exporter of energy after development of oil and gas production in the North Sea. Output fell back in the late 1980s following the [Piper Alpha disaster][1], with the UK temporarily regaining a position as a net exporter in the mid 1990s. However, North Sea production peaked in 1999, and the UK returned to being a net energy importer in 2004 – where it has remained since.\n\n###3. Gas and renewable energy are the main fuels used for UK electricity generation\n####Electricity supplied by fuel type, UK, 1980 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc339/Energy_Chart3/Energy_Chart3.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Electricity supplied by fuel type, UK, 1980 to 2015\"/>\n\nCoal and gas have been the main fuels used in the UK’s electricity generation since 1997. Although gas currently generates the largest amount of electricity, proportions have fluctuated over time, largely in line with prices. In 2015 renewables overtook coal for the first time to become the second largest generator of electricity. Renewable energy has grown steadily since 1980 – with renewable energy sources in 2015 accounting for 25% of total UK electricity generation. Of this, 60% came from wind and solar power.\n\nNuclear power has declined since its peak in 1998, corresponding with the closure of a number of nuclear reactors.\n\n###4. The UK’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are decreasing\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The UK has both international and domestic targets for reducing GHG emissions. The 2008 Climate Change Act established the world’s first legally binding emission target of reducing GHG emissions in the UK by at least 80% (from the 1990 baseline) by 2050.</ons-box>\n\n\nCarbon dioxide is responsible for the largest amount of GHG emissions, accounting for 82% of the total in 2014.\n\n###Emissions of greenhouse gases^3,^ UK, 1990 to 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc339/Energy_Chart4/Energy_Chart4.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Emissions of greenhouse gases\"/>\n\n - Total UK GHG emissions have dropped by 35% since 1990.\n - Total UK carbon dioxide emissions have decreased by around 29% since 1990.\n\nA number of factors have contributed to the reductions in emissions, including improvements in energy efficiency, investment in [low carbon technology, changes in the fuel mix for electricity generation, carbon budgets][2] and the EU Emissions Trading System [(EU ETS)][3].\n\n[Provisional greenhouse gas (GHG) emission figures][4] are available from the Department of Energy and Climate Change.\n\n####Conclusion: adapting to change\nThe way the UK sources and consumes energy has changed over time. Currently, more energy is imported than exported, and the transport sector remains the largest consumer of energy, a position it has held since 1988. Renewable energy sources have overtaken coal to become the 2nd largest generator of electricity in the UK in 2015, behind gas.\n\nIt is important that the UK is able to adapt to these kinds of ongoing changes and maintain its future energy security for many reasons, including meeting emissions targets and environmental protection – as well as economic prosperity.\n\n####Footnotes:\n\n1. Energy consumption by final user refers to energy that is not used for transformation into other forms of energy.\n2. Total energy consumption also includes a small amount of consumption from other final users which are mainly agriculture, public administration and commerce.\n3. The greenhouse gas total consists of seven greenhouse gases covered by the [Kyoto Protocol][5]. Nitrogen trifluoride emissions are being included in this total for the first time this year, following the introduction of updated guidelines for emissions reporting.\n\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_Alpha\n  [2]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-low-carbon-technologies/2010-to-2015-government-policy-low-carbon-technologies#appendix-1-bioenergy\n  [3]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-greenhouse-gas-emissions/2010-to-2015-government-policy-greenhouse-gas-emissions#appendix-2-eu-emissions-trading-system-eu-ets\n  [4]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/provisional-uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-national-statistics-2015\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol"

      "markdown": "This article in the [UK Perspectives][1] series presents interactive charts illustrating how the UK population and economy compares with the other 27 member states of the European Union (EU).\n\n\nThe charts presented here use the latest data published by Eurostat^1^ as these allow direct comparison between the EU countries. More recent data for the UK – including international migration, gross domestic product (GDP) and employment – have been published by ONS. The latest data for the UK, as well as a range of additional sources and information, can be accessed from the related links.\n\n###Population\n####The UK had the third largest population in the EU in 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc341/Europe_Pop/Europe.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The UK had the thirdÂ� largest population in the EU in 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data][2].\n\nOn January 1, 2015, Germany had the largest population^2^ of the EU countries (81.2 million people) – followed by France (66.4 million), the UK (64.9 million), Italy (60.8 million), Spain (46.4 million) and Poland (38.0 million).\n\nThese six countries accounted for approximately 70% of the EU’s total population, with the UK alone comprising 13% of the total EU population.\n\nThe UK had the fourth highest population density (266 people per square kilometre) of the EU countries in 2014, and was most similar to Germany (227 people per sq km). Malta had the highest at 1,352 people per sq km – more than double that of the Netherlands in second place (501 people per sq km) and 3rd placed Belgium (370 people per sq km).\n\n###Italy, Germany and Greece had the highest old-age dependency ratio in the EU in 2014\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The old-age dependency ratio (OADR) is a measure of the number of people aged 65 and over for every 100 people of working age (15–64). A higher OADR implies that there are more people aged 65 and over relative to people of working age. When comparing the OADR across EU countries, please note the state pension age (SPA) across the EU differs, affecting the proportion of people aged 65 and over who may be employed.</ons-box>\n\nThe UK’s OADR in 2014 was 27.0, which was broadly average for the EU and meant approximately one older person to every four people of working age. Italy had the highest OADR at 33.1, which equates to approximately one older person for every three people of working age. Germany and Greece also had relatively high OADR. Slovakia had the lowest OADR at 19.0, or approximately one older person to every five people of working age.\n\nThe OADR ratio is affected by [fertility][3], net migration and [life expectancy][4], and is an important driver of public spending – since there is likely to be increased demand for health services and pensions as the population ages.\n###Migration\n####The UK had the second highest level of long-term immigration in the EU in 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc341/Europe_Mig/Europe.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The UK had the second highest level of long-term immigrationÂ� in the EU in 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data][5].\n\nThe United Nations recommended definition of a long-term international migrant is someone who changes their country of residence for a period of at least 12 months. Net migration is the difference between the number of immigrants coming to a country and the number of emigrants leaving a country.\n\nThe six EU countries with the largest populations (Germany, France, UK, Italy, Spain and Poland) also experienced the highest levels of long-term immigration in 2014. Germany had the highest (885,000), followed by the UK (632,000) and France (340,000).\n\nOverall, 15 EU countries recorded positive values for net migration (immigration greater than emigration) in 2014. The countries with the highest positive net migration were Germany (+561,000), the UK (+313,000) and Italy (+141,000). These flows were equivalent to 0.7% of the total population in Germany, 0.5% in the UK and 0.2% in Italy.\n\nSpain recorded the highest level of long-term emigration in 2014 (400,000), followed by Germany (324,000) and the UK (319,000). There were 13 EU countries with negative values for net migration (emigration greater than immigration) in 2014, with Spain (-95,000), Greece (-48,000) and Poland (-46,000) being the top 3. These flows were equivalent to 0.2%, 0.4% and 0.1% of the resident population in Spain, Greece and Poland respectively.\n\nThe latest [UK international migration estimates][6] are available from ONS.\n###Economy\n####The UK’s GDP per capita was 9% higher than the EU average in 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc341/Europe_Eco/Europe.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The UKâ€™s GDP per capita wasÂ� 9% higher than the EU average in 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data][7].\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is a measure of the economic output produced per person in the country. The figures are expressed in purchasing power standards (PPS), with the EU average set to equal 100. A value for GDP per capita greater than 100 is above the EU average, and a value of GDP per capita below 100 is below the EU average. The use of PPS means figures are adjusted to remove differences in price levels between countries. This allows comparisons between countries within each year, although they should not be used to make comparisons over time.</ons-box>\n\nThe UK’s GDP per capita was the 10th highest in the EU in 2014, and was 9% higher than the EU average. This was comparable with France, where GDP was 7% higher than the EU average. Luxembourg was an outlier with the highest GDP per capita (with a value of 266 in 2014, making it more than 2.5 times the EU average).\n\nThe countries with the lowest GDP per capita were generally the newer members of the EU which have joined since 2004^3^, with Bulgaria the lowest at just under half (47%) of the EU average.\n\nThe UK’s annual GDP growth rate was 13th highest in the EU in 2015\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The calculation of the annual growth rate of GDP volume allows comparisons, both over time and between economies of different sizes. For measuring the growth rate of GDP in terms of volumes, the GDP at current prices is valued in the prices of the previous year. Therefore, price movements will not inflate the growth rate.</ons-box>\n\nIn 2015, the UK had the 13th highest growth rate in GDP of the EU countries – growing 2.3% compared with the previous year. It was the 5th highest growth rate among the 15 member states that joined the EU before 2004^4^.\n\nIreland had the fastest GDP growth rate in the EU in 2015, at 7.8%. The only EU country that saw a reduction in GDP in 2015 was Greece (-0.2%).\n\nThe UK’s government debt-to-GDP ratio is slightly above the EU average\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">Gross debt is a measure of how much a government owes at a point in time. The debt-to-GDP ratio frames the value of this debt relative to the size of the economy. However, there are many factors that determine the sustainability of national debt – including interest rates, term structures of debt and the currency in which it is denominated, as well as wider economic conditions. Therefore, a debt-to-GDP ratio that is sustainable in one country may not be sustainable in another.</ons-box>\n\nAt 89.2% of GDP, the UK had one of the higher general government gross debt-to-GDP ratios in the EU in 2015. There were five member states with debt-to-GDP ratios greater than 100% of GDP and nine with ratios below 50%. The highest debt-to-GDP ratio was for Greece, at 177%.\n\nComparing these debt ratios in 2015 with 2004 shows that debt has increased relative to GDP for the majority of countries where data are available. In 2004, there were two countries (Greece and Italy) with debt-to-GDP ratios of 100% or just over, while the UK had a debt-to-GDP ratio of 40.2%, making it one of 18 countries with a debt-to-GDP ratio at or below 50%.\n\nThe latest [UK GDP estimate][8] is available from ONS.\n\nEmployment rates are relatively high in the UK\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">The employment rate is an indicator of economic conditions (in addition to country-specific factors) in the labour market.</ons-box>\n\nThe UK had the 5th highest employment rate of the EU countries in 2015^5^, at 72.7%, and was one of eight EU countries with an employment rate greater than 70% of the active population.\n\nSweden had the highest employment rate in the EU, at 75.5%, while Greece had the lowest at 50.8%.\n\nThe latest [UK employment rate estimates][9] are available from ONS.\n\n\n\nFor more information, contact: [digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk][10]\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/introducing-uk-perspectives-2016/\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/population_data.xlsx\n  [3]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&language=en&pcode=tsdde220&plugin=1\n  [4]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&init=1&language=en&pcode=tps00025&plugin=1\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/migration_data.xlsx\n  [6]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/bulletins/migrationstatisticsquarterlyreport/previousReleases\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/economy_data.xlsx\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/timeseries/ihyq\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/timeseries/lf24\n  [10]: mailto:better.info@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

      "markdown": "This article presents key labour market measures in the UK from 1980 until 2016. It shows the changes in overall employment, unemployment and economic inactivity rates while also examining some of the reasons behind these changes.\n\n\nThis article is part of a series of [UK Perspectives][1], providing an overview of key aspects of the nation over the last three decades.\n###1. Employment rate at a record high^1^\nThe employment rate is the proportion of people aged 16 to 64 in work. Anyone doing one hour or more a week of paid work is counted in the employment figures.\n\n####Employment rate for people aged 16 to 64, UK, 1980 to 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc342/Labour_Chart1/Labour_Chart1.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Employment rate for people aged 16 to 64, UK, 1980 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][2].\n\n74.2% of people aged 16 to 64 were estimated to be employed in January 2016 to March 2016. This is as high as it has been since comparable records began in 1971.\n\nThe employment rate decreased during the three economic downturns of the early 1980s, early 1990s and late 2000s. This decrease was more pronounced in the early 1980s, when the employment rate fell to a low of 65.6% during 1983. The lowest value since the start of the late 2000s downturn was 70.1% in the latter part of 2011.\n\n###2. Employment rates have risen for people aged 25 and over\n####Employment rates for people aged 25 and over^2^, UK, 1992 to 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc342/Labour_Chart2/Labour_Chart2.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Employment rates for people aged 25 and over^2^, UK, 1992 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3].\n\nLooking at employment rates for all age groups of 25 and over, the data shows higher employment rates in 2016 than in 1992. In particular there has been a large increase in employment rates for both the 25 to 34 and the 50 to 64 age groups over the past two decades, while employment rates have also increased for those aged 65 and over.\n\nThe recent increase in employment rates for the 50 to 64 age group is partly due to the increase in the state pension age for women (from 60 to 65) being introduced gradually since 2010. However, the employment rate for this age group also rose between 1992 and 2010, prior to these changes.\n\n###… but not for those aged 16 to 24\n\nIn contrast to the older age groups, for young people aged 16 to 24, employment rates were lower in 2016 than in 1992. However, this is partly due to fewer young people seeking work due to increasing participation in full-time education.\n\n####Employment rates for people aged 16 to 24 not in full-time education, UK, 1992 to 2016\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc342/Labour_Chart3/Labour_Chart3.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Employment rates for people aged 16 to 24 not in full-time education, UK, 1992 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][4].\n\nTherefore, in the chart above, employment rates for these age groups are shown only for those young people not in full-time education. The data shows that for the 18 to 24 age group, employment rates are at similar level to the early 1990s, while for the 16 to 17 age group the employment rate has fallen.\n\n###3. The gap in the employment rates of men and women has narrowed\n####Employment rates for men and women aged 16 to 64, UK, 1980 to 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc342/Labour_Chart4/Labour_Chart4.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Employment rates for men and women aged 16 to 64, UK, 1980 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][5].\n\nHistorically the employment rate for men has been higher than the employment rate for women but this gap has narrowed considerably since 1980.\n\nThe employment rate for women has been rising steadily over time. The current rate and level of female employment are the highest since comparable records began in 1971. In January to March 2016, the employment rate for women was 69.2%, up from 56.9% in December to February 1980. In contrast, male employment rates are below their 1980 level.\n\n###4. The unemployment rate stands at 5.1%\nThe unemployment rate is the proportion of the economically active population who are unemployed. The economically active population is defined as all people aged 16 and over who are either in employment or unemployed. The unemployed are defined as people without a job who have been actively seeking work within the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks, and people waiting to start a new job.\n\n####Unemployment rate for people aged 16 and over, UK, 1980 to 2016\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc342/Labour_Chart5/Labour_Chart5.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Unemployment rate for people aged 16 and over, UK, 1980 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][6].\n\nIn January to March 2016, the unemployment rate for people aged 16 and over was 5.1%, continuing its downward trend since October to December 2011. The current rate is lower than the pre-2008 downturn rate of 5.2% for late 2007 / early 2008.\n\nThe highest unemployment peaks observed in the UK correspond with the economic recessions in the early 1980s and early 1990s. In 1984 unemployment peaked at 11.9%, and in December 1992 to February 1993 unemployment was 10.7%.\n\n###5. Changes in the share of unemployed classed as long-term unemployed\n####The long-term unemployed^3^, as a share of all the unemployed aged 16 and over, UK, 1992 to 2016\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc342/Labour_Chart6/Labour_Chart6.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The long-term unemployed^3^, as a share of all the unemployed aged 16 and over, UK, 1992 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][7].\n\nIn January to March 2016 the share of total unemployed classed as 'long-term unemployed' (meaning they had been out of work but looking for work for over 12 months) was 27.6%. This figure had peaked at 44.7% in February to April 1994. The lowest share recorded was 19.4% in June to August 2004 but this subsequently increased, mainly because of the late 2000s downturn. In recent years the share of unemployed classed as long term unemployed has been falling again.\n\n###6. The economic inactivity rate of women has fallen\nThe economic inactivity rate is measured as the proportion of people aged 16 to 64 not in work who have not been seeking work within the last four weeks and/or are not available to start work within the next two weeks.\n\n####Economic inactivity rate for people aged 16 to 64, UK, 1980 to 2016\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc342/Labour_Chart7/Labour_Chart7.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Economic inactivity rate for people aged 16 to 64, UK, 1980 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][8].\n\nThe economic inactivity rate tells us about the share of the population aged 16 to 64 who are not in work and not seeking/available to work. There are many reasons for economic inactivity such as study, looking after the family or home, sickness/disability or not needing to work.\n\nThe overall economic inactivity rate for January to March 2016 was 21.7%, equalling the lowest rate on record (this rate also occurred in 1989 and 1990).\n\nThe economic inactivity rate increased during the three economic downturns between 1980 and 2016. However, the latest increase in the late 2000s was very small; furthermore, there was no rise if we exclude full-time students.\n\nThe reasons for being economically inactive have evolved over the past decades. Factors that have influenced both male and female inactivity rates include an increase in inactivity due to full-time study and a decline in inactivity due to long-term sickness.\n\nMore gender specific factors have led to the narrowing of the gap between male and female inactivity rates. Since 2010, the decline in female inactivity rates has been influenced by increases in the state pension age. However, the main reason for the decline in female inactivity rates over the longer period has been a decline in the share of women staying out of work to look after the family or home.\n\n####Shares of men and women aged 16 to 64 who are economically inactive due to looking after the family or home, UK, 1993 to 2016\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc342/Labour_Chart8/Labour_Chart8.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Shares of men and women aged 16 to 64 who are economically inactive due to looking after the family or home, UK, 1993 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][9].\n\nThe share of women who are economically inactive due to looking after the family or home has gone down from 15.9% in March to May 1993 to 9.8% in January to March 2016. The share of men who are economically inactive due to looking after the family or home has increased from 0.6% to 1.2% over the same period.\n\n###Conclusion\nThe most recent economic downturn had less of an effect on overall employment and unemployment rates when compared with the downturns of the early 1980s and 1990s. Meanwhile, a key feature of the labour market since 1980 has been the continued increase in the employment rate and economic activity rate of women.\n\n\n\n####For more information, please contact: [digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk][10]\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/introducing-uk-perspectives-2016/\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Fig-1-employment-rate.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Fig-2-employment-rates-for-people-aged-25-and-over.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Fig-3-employment-rates-for-people-aged-16-to-24-not-in-full-time-education.csv\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Fig-4-employment-rates-for-men-and-women.csv\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Fig-5-unemployment-rate.csv\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Fig-6-long-term-unemployed.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Fig-7-economic-inactivity-rate.csv\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Fig-8-economic-inactivity-due-to-looking-after-family-or-home.csv\n  [10]: http://better.info@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1. The term 'record' refers to the full period for which data exist, 1971 until now.\n2. The employment rates by age group are the proportion of people in a particular age group that are in work; for example, the employment rate of people aged 25 to 34 is calculated dividing the total number of people aged 25 to 34 that are in work by the total number of people aged 25 to 34.\n3. Defined as those unemployed for over 12 months as a share of all the unemployed aged 16 and over."

      "markdown": "With people travelling around 6,500 miles per year^1^ on average, transport is a fundamental part of daily living and, therefore, plays an important role in our economy.\n\n\nThe transport industry is a substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter and, over time, has become an increasingly large energy consumer. This inevitably impacts the environment – as illustrated in [Energy and Emissions in the UK][2].\n\nThis article in the [UK Perspectives][3] series presents some key statistics relating to how passenger transport has changed over time in Great Britain.\n\nIt is important to note there is likely to be subnational variation within the data, particularly between rural and urban areas. As transport policy in Northern Ireland is fully devolved, transport statistics for [Northern Ireland][4] are recorded separately.\n\n###1.Distance travelled by car has increased\n####Passenger transport by mode^2^ Great Britain, 1980 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc340/Transport_Chart1/Transport_Chart1.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Passenger transport by mode^2^Â� Great Britain, 1980 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][5]\n\nSince 1980, the total distance travelled has increased, predominantly due to increased travel via cars, vans and taxis. Between 1980 and 1990 growth was rapid; this then steadied until 2007, when the distance travelled leveled and then fell slightly to remain at around 770 billion passenger kilometres to 2013. In 2014 passenger kilometers travelled rose to 788 billion.\n\nDistance travelled by rail has also risen, particularly in the last 20 years – the distance travelled in 2014 was more than double that in 1980 at 75 billion passenger kilometres.\n\nThe share of the distance travelled by cars, vans and taxis has remained fairly stable, and in 2014 were still by far the most used modes of transport, accounting for 83% of all passenger distance travelled in Great Britain. The number of licensed motor vehicles has continued to rise, increasing in every year but one, from 19 million in 1980 to an all-time high of 35.6 million in 2014^3^.\n\nBuses and coaches accounted for the second largest proportion of all distance travelled in 1980. However, distance travelled by buses and coaches has since declined and from 2001 rail was the mode of transport responsible for the second largest distance travelled in Great Britain.\n\n###2. Rail accounts for the most distance travelled on public transport\n####Passenger kilometres on public transport, Great Britain, 1985/86 to 2014/15\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc340/Transport_Chart2/Transport_Chart2.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Passenger kilometres on public transport, Great Britain, 1985/86 to 2014/15\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n\n\nIn 1985/86 the largest proportion of distance travelled on public transport was by bus. However, by 2014/15 rail accounted for 63% of all passenger kilometres, over double that for buses (29%). Passenger distance travelled by light rail and tram, although relatively low (1.6 billion passenger kilometres in 2014/15) has increased fivefold since 1985/86. Distance travelled by underground was 10.9 billion passenger kilometres in 2014/15, an 82% increase since 1985/86.\n\n###3. Buses account for the majority of passenger journeys on public transport\n####Passenger journeys on public transport vehicles, Great Britain, 1985/86 to 2014/15^4^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc340/Transport_Chart3/Transport_Chart3.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Passenger journeys on public transport vehicles, Great Britain, 1985/86 to 2014/15^4^\"/>[Download the data][8]\n\nWhile rail accounts for the most distance travelled by public transport, the highest number of all journeys on public transport in Great Britain in 2014/15 were via bus (62%).\n\nThe number of bus journeys in Great Britain outside of London has fallen by more than a third since 1985/86, while the number of bus journeys in London has doubled over the same period. Over half of all bus passenger journeys in England in 2014/15 occurred in London^5^ suggesting bus travel in London is an important driver of overall trends in Great Britain. In 2014/15 bus passenger journeys increased inside London and decreased outside of London.\n\nPassenger journeys by rail in Great Britain have more than doubled since 1991/92, to 20% of public transport journeys in 2014/15. Journeys by light rail and tram, as well as the underground, have also risen in recent years; they were the highest ever in 2014/15, at 0.24 and 1.32 billion journeys respectively.\n\n###4. Air passenger numbers were four times greater in 2015 than in 1980\n####Air traffic: UK airports, 1991 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc340/Transport_Chart4/Transport_Chart4.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Air traffic: UK airports, 1991 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][10]\n\nSince 1991, the volume of passengers at UK airports has more than doubled – from 95 million to 251 million in 2015. The number of commercial aircraft take-offs and landings has also increased, from 1.4 million in 1991 to 2.2 million in 2015.\n\nCompared with 58 million passengers in 1980, air passenger numbers in 2015 were over four times greater, and aircraft take-offs and landings more than double^6^. Following strong historic growth, air traffic fell during the recent economic downturn (2008 and 2009), as well as in 2010, coinciding with volcanic ash and severe winter weather disruption. Passenger numbers increased by 5.5% in 2015, reaching a record number and exceeding the previous peak in 2007. Commercial aircraft movements have remained fairly level since the economic downturn, suggesting the increase in passenger numbers could be due to increasing aircraft size and numbers of passengers per plane.\n\nThere were 75 million passengers at Heathrow airport in 2015, an increase of 1.5 million from 2014 and accounting for 30% of the total passengers at all UK airports. This was almost twice as many as Gatwick, the second largest UK airport (40 million)^7^.\n###5. Numbers of road accidents and casualties have fallen\nReported road accidents, Great Britain, 1980 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc340/Transport_Chart5/Transport_Chart5.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Reported road accidents\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][13]\n\nThe number of reported road traffic accidents decreased from 252,000 in 1980 to 146,000 in 2014, a reduction of almost 42%. This is despite the number of licensed motor vehicles having almost doubled since 1980. Road accidents decreased steadily from 2000 to 2013, but increased by 7,000 from 2013 to 2014.\n\nThe rise in road accidents in 2014 was the first increase since 1997 and is likely to be as a result of a combination of factors. Vehicle traffic levels increased by 2.4% between 2013 and 2014, the largest single year growth since 1996. Weather conditions may also have had a role - most months were considerably warmer than average and this is liable to have contributed to a higher number of accidents^8^.\n\n###6. The number of car occupant injuries in accidents has seen the greatest reduction\n####Killed or seriously injured from road accidents, Great Britain, 1980 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc340/Transport_Chart6/Transport_Chart6.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Killed or seriously injured from road accidents, Great Britain, 1980 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][15]\n\nThe number of seriously injured casualties has fallen by nearly three quarters since 1980^9^. In addition the number of fatalities from road accidents has fallen by 70%, from almost 6,000 in 1980 to under 2,000 in 2014. This is almost 80% lower than the worst peacetime toll of 7,985 road traffic deaths, recorded in 1966.\n\nThe number of people killed or seriously injured in road accidents is higher in car occupants than any other group of road users. However, the number of car occupants killed or seriously injured has fallen more quickly than the corresponding number of pedestrians, pedal cyclists and motor cyclists (these groups are commonly referred to as 'vulnerable road users'). The rate of injury (in terms of passenger miles travelled) for car occupants is also much lower than for vulnerable road users.  This is partly because of advanced vehicle technology providing improved protection.\n\nConsequentially, the numbers of different road users killed or seriously injured are more similar in 2014. From 1985, pedestrian deaths or serious injuries became more common than for motorcycle riders or passengers – although this difference is now smaller than it was between the mid 1980s and start of the 2000s. From 2004 to 2012 the number of pedal cyclists killed or seriously injured increased; the numbers fell slightly in 2013 but increased in the latest 2014 figure.\n\nThe main reason for the rise in pedal cyclist casualties is probably the increased distance cycled on the roads – evidence from the national road traffic estimates and National Travel Survey suggests this rose by more than a fifth in the decade ending 2014.\n\n###Conclusion\nIn general, people are travelling greater distances – mostly by car. Public transport usage patterns have also changed, with differences between modes used for distance travelled and the number of journeys. Within these patterns, there is also considerable subnational variation – the related links section has more information.\n\nThe number of road accidents, meanwhile, has fallen considerably since 1980. In addition to the accompanying decline in deaths and serious injuries, this trend would also help to reduce traffic congestion – and the demand for and cost to emergency, health and welfare services.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: [digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk][17]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/489894/tsgb-2015.pdf\n  [2]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-perspectives-energy-and-emissions\n  [3]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/introducing-uk-perspectives-2016/\n  [4]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.drdni.gov.uk/ni_transport_statistics.htm\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Table-1-Passenger-transport-by-mode.csv\n  [6]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras40-reported-accidents-vehicles-and-casualties\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Table-2_Passenger-kilometres-on-public-transport.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Table-3-Passenger-journeys-on-public-transport-v2.csv\n  [9]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/bus01-local-bus-passenger-journeys\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Table-4-Air-traffic-UK-airports.csv\n  [11]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/tsgb02\n  [12]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/tsgb02\n  [13]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Table-5_Road-accidents.csv\n  [14]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/463049/rrcgb2014-03.pdf\n  [15]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Table-6_Road-casualties.csv\n  [16]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/ras30-reported-casualties-in-road-accidents\n  [17]: better.info@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

      "markdown": "Understanding the size and characteristics of a country’s population is vital when it comes to planning and delivering services like education, transport and healthcare.\n\n\nPopulation change occurs as a result of births, deaths and net migration (the difference between immigration and emigration). These factors may also affect the age and sex structure of the population.\n\nPart of a[ series of UK Perspectives][1] providing an overview of key aspects of the nation over the last 4 decades, this article presents some key statistics relating to the changing UK population.\n\n###1. The UK population has grown by 8.4 million since 1975\n####Mid-year population estimates for the UK, 1975 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc335/Pop_Chart1/Pop_Chart1.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Mid-year population estimates for the UK, 1975 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][2]\n\nSince 1975, the UK population has grown by 8.4 million people (14.9%), to 64.6 million in 2014. Around half of this growth has occurred since 2005, due to an increase in the number of births and an increase in net inward migration through the 2000s.\n\n###2. What is driving UK population growth?\n####Factors driving UK population change, mid-year estimates, 1992 to 2014^1^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc335/Pop_Chart2/Pop_Chart2.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Factors driving UK population change, mid-year estimates, 1992 to 2014^1^\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][3]\n\nBetween 1999 and 2011 net migration was the main component of population change in the UK. However, births have exceeded deaths throughout the last two decades and since 2002 there has been a marked increase in the number of births, with 2012 having the highest number since 1972. The increase in the number of births has been driven both by the immigration of women who are currently of childbearing age and by rising fertility among UK-born women.\n\nIn the year to mid-2014, the population increased by 491,100. Of this increase 54% (264,900) was due to net international migration which is the difference between international immigration and international emigration during the year. The remaining 46% (226,200) was due to natural change or the difference between births and deaths.\n\nCurrent and past international migration also has indirect effects on the size of the population as it changes the number of births and deaths in the UK. For example, statistics on the number of births by the country of birth of the mother show that 200,023 live births (26% of total live births) in the UK in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK.\n###3. The UK’s ageing population: life expectancy predicted to rise steadily for men and women\n####Cohort life expectancy at birth, UK, 1980 to 2039\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc335/Pop_Chart3/Pop_Chart3.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Cohort life expectancy at birth, UK, 1980 to 2039\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][4]\n\nA boy born in the UK in 1980 could expect to live 84.4 years on average. For a boy born today (2016) the figure is 90.6 years and, based on current assumptions, by 2039 it is projected to be 93.9 years.\n\nSimilarly, a girl born in 1980 could expect to live 88.0 years on average. For a girl born today (2016) the figure is 93.5 years and, based on current assumptions, by 2039 it is projected to be 96.5 years.\n\nWith life expectancy increasing, the UK’s population will age. This will affect a number of policy areas, including pensions and the health service – particularly because healthy life expectancy is not increasing as quickly.\n\n###4. Changes to state pension age impacts the old age dependency ratio\nThe old age dependency ratio (OADR) measures the number of people of State Pension Age (SPA) and over for every 1,000 people of working age (16 to SPA). The OADR provides an idea of the relationship between working and pensioner populations.\n\n####Old age dependency ratio (OADR), UK, 1980 to 2039^2^^3^^4^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc335/Pop_Chart4/Pop_Chart4.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Old age dependency ratio (OADR), UK, 1980 to 2039^2^^3^^4^\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][5]\n\nThe OADR was steady at around 300 from the 1980s to 2006, but rose in 2007-09 as women born in the post-World War II baby boom reached SPA. In the absence of any increases to SPA, it would reach 487 by 2039; but, as a result of planned SPA increases taking place between 2010 and 2046 under current legislation, it is expected that – for every 1,000 people of working age in 2039 – there will be 370 people of SPA.\n\nThe increase in the OADR means there will be fewer people of working age to support a larger population over SPA.\n\n###5. The number of UK residents aged 90 and over has almost tripled since the early 1980s\n####UK residents aged 90 and over per 100,000 UK residents, 1983 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc335/Pop_Chart5/Pop_Chart5.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK residents aged 90 and over per 100,000 UK residents, 1983 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data][6]\n\nAlthough the 90 and over group account for only a very small proportion of the UK population (0.9% in 2014), the size of this age group relative to the rest has increased over time. This illustrates the UK’s ageing population.\n\n###Conclusion: An increasing and ageing population\nThe UK population is both increasing and ageing. Current projections show this pattern is set to continue, reaching a projected 74.3 million by 2039.\n\nThat’s an increase of 9.2 million (14%) compared with 2015 as a result of births minus deaths, plus net migration.\n\nWhile a larger population increases the size and productive capacity of the workforce, it also increases demand for education, healthcare and housing.\n\nMeanwhile, longer life expectancy is resulting in a growing older population. People working longer will increase the size of the labour force, but there will also be further pressure on services. The old age dependency ratio is expected to increase in future years, although planned changes to the State Pension Age will slow this increase.\n\nPlease see related links for other relevant data sources and analysis.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: [digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk][7]\n\n\n  [1]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/introducing-uk-perspectives-2016/\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Pop_Chart1.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Pop_Chart2.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Pop_Chart3.csv\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Pop_Chart4.csv\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/05/Pop_Chart5.csv\n  [7]: http://better.info@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1. Net international migration includes other small population changes, such as changes to armed forces between UK and overseas.\n2. This chart is an update to the OADR chart found in Pension Trends, Chapter 2: Population change (2012 edition). Here the OADR from 1980 to 2014 is based on 2014 mid-year estimates. From 2015, the OADR uses 2014-based mid-year projections.\n3. Population projections are uncertain and become increasingly uncertain the further they are carried forward in time. They do not attempt to predict the impact that future government policies, changing economic circumstances or other factors might have on demographic behaviour.\n4. SPA changes take into account current legislation but do not take into account proposed future changes to the state pension age that are yet to become law. For the purposes of this analysis, the changes are applied to the UK population, although it should be noted that pensions in Northern Ireland are a devolved matter."

      "markdown": "International migration has been a major topic of discussion in the debate around the EU referendum. But how much migration is there between the UK and the rest of the EU^1^, and how does that compare with migration to and from the rest of the world?\n\n\nPart of a[ series of UK Perspectives][1] providing an overview of key aspects of the nation over the last four decades, this article presents some key statistics relating to International migration to and from the UK.\n\nThere are two types of migration to and from the UK.\n\n\n- ‘Long-term’ migration is when a person moves country for 12 months or more. It is used in official net migration figures, which help inform our population estimates and projections. It is also used to measure progress towards the government’s ambition to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands a year.\n- ‘Short-term’ migration is when a person moves country for between one and 12 months. People visiting a country for less than one month are excluded from these figures.\n\n\n###What are the levels of long-term international migration in the UK?\n\nONS statistics on long-term international migrants include three main measures:\n\n\n- Immigration – number of people who have moved to the UK for at least a year.\n- Emigration – number of people who have left the UK for at least a year.\n- Net migration – the difference between the number of people moving to live in the UK and the number of people moving out of the UK to live elsewhere.\n\n\nIn 2015^2^ an estimated^3^ 630,000 people immigrated to live in the UK. This is over twice as many as the 297,000 people who emigrated from the UK to live abroad, resulting in a net migration estimate of 333,000.\n\nNet migration hasn’t always been positive in the UK. Between 1964 and 1979 more people left the UK overall than arrived to live in the UK.\n\nSince 1994 the number of people immigrating to the UK has consistently been greater than the number emigrating each year.\n\nOver the last two decades, both immigration and emigration have increased, with immigration exceeding emigration by more than 100,000 in every year since 1998.\n\n \n\n####Long-Term International Migration, UK, 1964 to 2015^4^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc330/fig1/fig1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Long-Term International Migration, UK, 1964 to 2015^4^\"/>\n[Download the data][2].\n\nRecent peaks have coincided with new countries’ accession to the EU. For example, between 2003 and 2004, immigration increased 15% reaching a record high at the time of 589,000. This coincided with accession of the EU8 – the eight central and eastern European countries that joined the EU on May 1, 2004: Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.\n\nIn January 2007, Bulgaria and Romania (the EU2) joined the EU. However, migrants coming to the UK from these countries were initially subject to transitional employment restrictions, which placed limits on the kind of employment they could undertake. These restrictions ended on January 1, 2014.\n\n###Where do long-term immigrants to the UK come from?\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc330quizelements/Q1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Where do long-term immigrants to the UK come from?\"/>\n\nIn 2015, a total of 44% (277,000) of long-term immigrants to the UK were non-EU citizens, 43% (270,000) were EU citizens and 13% (83,000) were British citizens.\n\n####Long-term International Immigration to the UK by citizenship, 1975 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc330/fig2/fig2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Long-term International Immigration to the UK by citizenship, 1975 to 2015\"/>\n[Download the data][3].\n\nNon-EU citizens continue to account for a slightly larger share of immigration than EU citizens.\n\nLong-Term International Immigration to the UK by citizenship, 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc330/fig3/fig3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Non-EU citizens continue to account for a slightly larger share of immigration than EU citizens\"/>\n[Download the data][4].\n\nBritish citizens immigrating to the UK may be returning to the UK after living abroad for a period and some will be British citizens who were born abroad^5^.\n\nIn 2015 EU15^6^ citizens accounted for just under half (129,000) of all people immigrating from the EU. EU8^7^ citizens from Central and Eastern Europe make up 27% (73,000) of all people immigrating from the EU. Bulgaria and Romania (the EU2) account for practically all (97%) of the immigration in the ‘Other EU'^8^ category.\n\nThe most common nationality entering the UK (excluding British) was Indian with 46,000 people immigrating in 2014. China was second in the list with 39,000 people. The top three EU countries with the highest numbers of citizens immigrating to the UK were Romania (37,000), Poland (32,000) and France (24,000).\n\n###Why do people migrate to the UK?\nThe most common reason for migrating to the UK in 2015 was for ‘work-related’ reasons. In 2015, 294,000^9^  people from outside the UK migrated to the UK for ‘work-related’ reasons. Of these, 61% (178,000) were from EU citizens, 24% (72,000) were non-EU citizens and the rest (44,000) were British citizens.\n\n####Main reason^10^ for immigration for foreign born residents migrating to the UK in 2015^11^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc330/fig4/fig4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Main reason^10^Â� for immigration for foreign born residents migrating to the UK in 2015^11^\"/>\n[Download the data][6].\n\nThe second most common reason for migrating to the UK in 2015 was to ‘study’. In 2015, 156,000 people from outside the UK migrated to the UK to ‘study’. Of these, 72% (112,000) were non-EU citizens, 23% (36,000) were EU citizens and the rest (9,000) were British citizens.\n\n###How do levels of emigration from the UK differ by citizenship?\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc330quizelements/Q2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"How do levels of emigration from the UK differ by citizenship?\"/>\n\nBritish citizens accounted for 41% (123,000) of emigrants in 2015. The other 59% was split fairly evenly between EU citizens (85,000) and non-EU citizens (89,000) emigrating from the UK.\n####Long-Term International Emigration from the UK by citizenship, 1991 to 2015, UK\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc330/fig5/fig5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Long-Term International Emigration from the UK by citizenship, 1991Â� to 2015, UK\"/>\n[Download the data][7].\n\nRecent levels of emigration have remained stable and well below the high of 427,000 in 2008.\n\n####UK Net Long-Term International Migration by citizenship, 1975 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc330/fig6/fig6/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK Net Long-Term International Migration by citizenship, 1975 to 2015\"/>\n[Download the data][8].\n\nThe flow of people coming to live in the UK from outside the EU increased in the mid 1990s and has remained at relatively high levels. The net number of non-EU migrants has always been higher than the net number of EU migrants, though over the last decade the numbers have become much closer.\n\nNet migration from the EU was small until 2004 when it increased substantially coinciding with the accession of the EU8.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2014, net migration from the EU more than doubled from 82,000 to 174,000 as a result of increased immigration. This follows Croatia joining the EU in July 2013^12^ and the lifting of work restrictions for EU2 nationals from January 2014. In addition, a comparatively strong economy during this time may have made the UK attractive as a place to live.\n\n###Short-Term International Migration, UK\n\n####There are three widely used definitions of short-term migrants:\n\n\n- United Nations (UN) definition of a short-term migrant - three to 12 months for the purposes of work or study.\n- Three to 12 months - all reasons for migration, this includes the UN definition and the category ‘other’^13^.\n- One to 12 months - all reasons for migration, this includes the above but for one to 12 months. As such this definition captures more visits made for holidays and to visit family and friends.\n\n\n###What are the levels of short-term (less than one year) international migration to and from England and Wales?\nThere were an estimated 1.2 million short-term (one to 12 months) international migrants to England and Wales in the 12 months to June 2014.^14^  Of these, 719,000 million (62%) were for ‘other’ reasons such as holidays and visiting family and friends^15^. An estimated 2.4 million short-term international migrants left England and Wales for other countries outside the UK in the same period.\n\n####Short-term international migration flows, year ending June 2004 to year ending June 2014, England and Wales\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc330/fig7/fig7/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Short-term international migration flows, year ending June 2004 to year ending June 2014, England and Wales\"/>\n[Download the data][9].\n\nThree out of four (73%) short-term visits to England and Wales were for periods of between one and three months, while the remainder were for 3 to 12 months in 2014. Five out of six (84%) short-term visits away from the UK were for periods of between one and three months, while the remainder were for three to 12 months in 2014.\n\nBritish citizens accounted for 14% (167,000) of those visiting England and Wales for one to 12 months in 2014. The remainder was spread equally between EU (41%) and non-EU (45%) citizens.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc330quizelements/Q3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"What are the main reasons for short-term (1 to 12 months) international visits to England and Wales?\"/>\n\nPeople coming to England and Wales for short-term visits do so for a variety of reasons, such as to see what it is like, study, potentially look for short term work, to conduct business, improve language skills or visit friends and relatives.\n\nThe most popular (62% of all visits) reason to visit England and Wales for one to 12 months was for ‘other reasons’, which includes things like holidays, travelling, improving language skills and visiting friends/family. The remainder of all visits (439,000) were fairly evenly split between ‘employment and business’ (242,000) and ‘study’ (196,000) visits.\n\nReasons for short-term visits differ depending on length of stay. For stays of between one to three months, ‘other reasons’ make up 71% (601,000) of all visits. Whereas the split of visits between the reasons for short-term migrants staying three to 12 months were more evenly spread.\n\nIn 2014, 317,000 short-term (three to 12 months) international visits to England and Wales were made. Of these, 35% (112,000) were ‘employment and business’ visits, 27% (87,000) were to study, and 37% (118,000) were for ‘other reasons’.\n\n###What are the main reasons for short-term (three to 12 months) international visits away from England and Wales?\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc330quizelements/Q4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"What are the main reasons for short-term (three to 12 months) international visits away from England and Wales?\"/>\n\nBritish citizens accounted for 71% of all short-term (one to 12 month) visits from England and Wales to other countries in 2014.\n\nNon-EU citizens accounted for 16% of visits and the remaining 13% were made by EU citizens.\n\nThe most popular reason for visits away from England and Wales for one to 12 months was ‘Other’, at 91% (2.2 million), which includes things like holidays, travelling, improving language skills and visiting friends/family. The remaining 9% of visits were split between work (191,000) and study (41,000).\n\nAnalysis breaking down visits away from the UK into one to three month and three to 12 month categories show that stays for ‘Other’ reasons are lower for durations of three to 12 months (83%) compared to visits of between one to three months (92%).\n\n‘Employment and business’ accounted for 7% (140,000) of people visiting other countries for one to three months in 2014. The remaining 1% (23,000) of visits were for ‘study’.\n\n13% of visits for three to 12 months away from England and Wales were for work and 5% were for study. The majority (90%) of international visits away from England and Wales for three to 12 months for ‘employment and business’ were made by British citizens.\n\nUntil now we have been talking about flows of migrants coming to or leaving the UK in a given year. Now we talk about the total number of people living in the UK but born elsewhere and people born in the UK living in other countries – also known as stocks of migrants.\n\n###How has migration changed the population of the UK?\nThe UK population has become more culturally diverse, with a higher number of residents born outside the UK than ever before^16^.\n\nIn 2004, 9% or 5.3 million of the resident UK population were born outside the UK. In 2014, this had increased to 13% (8.3 million people^17^).\n\nIn 2004, 3% of people living in the UK were born in EU member countries (excluding UK) and 6% were born in non-EU countries. In 2014, this had increased to 5% born in EU member countries and 8% born in non-EU countries.\n\n####Population by country of birth, 2004 and 2014, UK\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc330/fig8/fig8/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Population by country of birth, 2004 and 2014, UK\"/>\n[Download the data][10].\n\n###How do short term migrants change the population of England and Wales?\nIt is possible to estimate the impact of short-term international migration on the overall population. In the year ending June 2014, the stock estimates showed that, on average, during the year there were 420,000 short-term emigrants away from England and Wales compared with 241,000 short-term immigrants in England and Wales using the one to 12 month definition.\n\n####Non-UK born population, Year ending June 2014, England and Wales\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc330/fig9/fig9/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Non-UK born population, Year ending June 2014, England and Wales\"/>\n\n[Download the data][11].\n\nThe 241,000 short-term immigrants who, on average, are resident during the year is small compared to the 7.8 million^18^ residents of England and Wales who were born outside the UK. Nearly three out of four (73%) short-term migrants leave within three months of arriving in the UK and all leave within a year.\n\n###Why are National Insurance Number (NiNo) allocations to overseas nationals different to IPS estimates of long-term international migration?\nRecently, questions have been raised as to why National Insurance Number (NINo) allocations to adult overseas nationals are much higher than the IPS estimates of Long-Term International Migrants coming into the UK.\n\nOn May 12 2016 ONS published an [ information note][12] explaining these sources vary for good reason – by definition, they measure slightly different migrant populations.\n\nShort-term migration (one to 12 months) to the UK largely accounts for the recent differences between the number of long-term migrants (as estimated by the International Passenger Survey (IPS)) and the number of National Insurance number (NINo) registrations for EU citizens.\n\nNINo allocations to overseas nationals are issued when someone successfully applies to work in the UK. NINo allocations can be made to short as well as long-term migrants and are only registered when the application process has finished. This is likely to be after the person migrated to the UK.\n\nONS Long-Term International Migration statistics are based on the International Passenger Survey (IPS). The definition of a long-term migrant is someone who moves to a country other than that of his or her usual residence for a period of at least a year (12 months), so that the country of destination becomes his or her new country of usual residence.\n\nIn summary, these data sources are not directly comparable with each other. Estimates derived from the IPS remain the most appropriate for measuring long-term immigration. NINo registrations data are not a good measure of long-term immigration but they do provide a valuable source of information for highlighting emerging changes in patterns of migration. For more information on the analysis carried out, see the [ note][13] that was published.\n\n\nMore information, contact [digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk][15]\n\nCorrections \n\nPlease note that the following corrections were applied to this article:\n\nThe title How do short term migrants change the population of UK? was changed to How do short term migrants change the population of England and Wales?\n\nThe key on the chart Non-UK born population, Year ending June 2014, England and Wales was changed from Short-term migrants resident in the UK to Short-term migrants resident in E&W\n\nThe chart title Long-Term International Migration, UK, 1964 to 2015 was changed to Long-Term International Migration, UK, 1965 to 2015\n\nThe chart title Long-Term International Emigration from the UK by citizenship, 2005 to 2015, UK was changed to  Long-Term International Emigration from the UK by citizenship, 1991 to 2015, UK\n\nIn the chart Short-term international migration flows, year ending June 2004 to year ending June 2014, England and Wales the labels for Inflow for 3-12 months and Outflow for 3-12 months were mixed up.

Some of these deaths are consequently registered in a different year to which the death occurred.\n\n\nWhen looking at the causes of death in 2015, for the most part more men died at each single year of age until 83^1^, from which greater numbers of women died.\n\nStudies have shown males are [more fragile][1] as foetuses and babies under 1 year. This continues throughout childhood with larger numbers of males dying than females. The greater number of women dying from age 83 is linked to women living longer than men.\n\n####Death registrations by age, England and Wales, 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc348/charts/linechart_death_1/line_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Death registrations by age, England and Wales, 2015\"/>\n[Download the data.][2]\n\nThe interactive graphic shows the number or percentage of deaths by broad underlying cause and sex, for single years of age, and the group aged 100 and over.\n###What are the most common causes of death by age? Find out with our interactive graphic.\n####Distribution of death registrations by underlying cause, sex and age, England and Wales, 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc348/interactive/stackedpyramid/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Distribution of death registrations by underlying cause, sex and age, England and Wales, 2015\"/>\n\n###Defining cause of death\nThe underlying cause of death is defined as the disease or injury which initiated the chain of morbid events leading directly to death, or the accident/act which produced the fatal injury.\n\nThe World Health Organisation [International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10)][3] is used to code cause of death for deaths over 28 days. More information is available in our [User guide to mortality statistics][4].\n\nBroad underlying causes are referred to in this article. For example, Cancer, which include specific causes such as breast cancer. The list of ICD-10 broad causes with examples are available in the table.\n\nStatistics are also published by leading causes of death which refer to more specific cause of death groups. Figures for 2015 are due to be published in autumn 2016.\n\n\nOnly 5% of people who died in 2015 were under the age of 50.\n\nFor this group the number of deaths by single year of age can be quite small. This makes it difficult to see individual causes of death on the interactive chart showing numbers of deaths.\n\nThe chart can be switched from number of deaths to percentage which helps us to see the main causes of death in these younger age groups; it represents the percentage of deaths from each broad cause at a particular single year of age, based on the total number of deaths at that age.\n###How does our sex affect what we die from?\nAges 5 to 49\nExternal causes, for example, accidents and suicides^2^, were the most common broad cause of death for people aged 5 to 49 in 2015; 38% of male and 20% of female deaths registered across these ages were due to external causes in 2015. Over three times as many deaths from external causes were registered to males than females in 2015.\n\nStudies have shown that the frontal lobe, the main part of the brain associated with planning, working memory, and impulse control, is not fully developed until well into our twenties^3^. For this reason, young people are more likely to act impulsively and take life-threatening risks.\n\nExternal causes accounted for 45% of male and 30% of female deaths at ages 5 to 19 in 2015. In 2014, vehicle^4^ accidents were the first and second leading specific causes of death for females and males respectively, aged 5 to 19, in England and Wales, accounting for 11% of deaths at this age^5^. [Worldwide, road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among young people aged 15 to 29][8].\n\nExternal causes were the most common broad cause of death for both males and females aged 20 to 34 and males aged 35 to 49. For females aged 35 to 49 it was the second most common broad cause behind cancer, which accounted for 42% of deaths.\n\nSuicide, including injury or poisoning of undetermined intent, has been one of the top 3 leading specific causes of death for people aged 5 to 49 in recent years, accounting for around 12% of deaths registered at these ages in 20145. Around 80% of these deaths are male; recent studies have linked the excess of male suicides to pressures of economic hardship^6^, new challenges of mid-life and personality traits such as emotional illiteracy^7^.\n####Over 3 times more deaths from external causes were registered to males than females at ages 5 to 49 in 2015\n####Deaths due to external causes, England and Wales, 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc348/charts/linechart_death_2/line_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Deaths due to external causes, England and Wales, 2015\"/>\n[Download the data.][11]\n\nAges 50 and over\nCancer (28%) was the most common broad cause of death for men and women aged 50 and over in 2015, followed by heart disease and strokes (27%) and respiratory diseases (15%).\n\nMore men than women died at ages 50 to 79 (31,191 more men); a consequence of [men having a shorter life expectancy than women][12]. As a result, at these ages almost every cause of death has a greater number of men dying compared to women.\n\nAt ages 80 and over, the pattern reversed with 52,930 more women dying than men; this is because there are relatively fewer men than women living at these ages given the differences in life expectancy.\n\nCancer and heart disease and strokes were the top broad causes of death for men and women aged 50 to 79 in 2015, accounting for 42% and 25% of deaths registered respectively.\n\nCancer killed more women than men at ages 35 to 49, but more men than women at ages 50 to 79 in 2015. In recent years, breast cancer has been the leading cause of death for women aged 35 to 49 while at ages 50 to 79 lung cancer was the most common cancer for men and women4.\n\nHeart disease and strokes killed 183 men for every 100 women aged 50 to 79 in 2015. Studies suggest biological and behavioural reasons for the higher number of male deaths from heart disease, such as a higher percentage of men who [smoke][13] and [drink][14]. In addition, men are less likely than women to visit the doctor, leading to later diagnosis and treatment. Studies have also linked oestrogen in pre-menopausal women to the lower incidence of heart disease in women.\n\nAt ages 80 and over, heart disease and strokes and cancer were the top broad causes of death for men and women in 2015, accounting for 28% and 19% of deaths registered respectively. At these ages, deaths from mental and behavioural disorders increase notably.\n\nIn 2015, 88% of deaths from mental and behavioural disorders occurred at ages 80 and over; with two-thirds of these being to women. This represents the greater number of women surviving to age 80 and above. The majority of these deaths are due to dementia and Alzheimer disease.\n###Twice as many women died of mental and behavioural disorders (including dementia and Alzheimer disease) aged 80 and over, compared with men, in 2015\n####Deaths due to mental and behavioural disorders, England and Wales, 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc348/charts/linechart_death_3/line_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Deaths due to mental and behavioural disorders, England and Wales, 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][15]\n\nThe likelihood of developing dementia and Alzheimer disease increases with age. As life expectancy is greater for females than males, women are more likely to survive to older ages, where they are at increased risk of developing such diseases. [Scientists have shown][16], however, that even when correcting for age, women are at greater risk from dementia and Alzheimer disease. It is not yet clear why.\n\nThe cause of death interactive was inspired by Nathan Yau’s earlier interactive [causes of death][17].\n\nFor more information on deaths please visit our web pages or e-mail us at: <vsob@ons.gov.uk>\n\n<ons-table path=\"212f1e5d\" />\n\n  [1]: http://www.statisticsviews.com/details/feature/9478781/Where-have-all-the-women-gone.html?platform=hootsuite\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/07/data.csv\n  [3]: http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatistics\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/suicidesintheunitedkingdom/2014registrations\n  [6]: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2892678/\n  [7]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/mortality-statistics--deaths-registered-in-england-and-wales--series-dr-/2014/sty-what-do-we-die-from.html\n  [8]: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs358/en/\n  [9]: http://www.bmj.com/content/345/bmj.e5142\n  [10]: http://www.samaritans.org/sites/default/files/kcfinder/files/Samaritans_Men_and_Suicide_Report_web.pdf\n  [11]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/07/data-1.csv\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/articles/howhaslifeexpectancychangedovertime/2015-09-09\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/bulletins/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain/2014\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/drugusealcoholandsmoking/bulletins/opinionsandlifestylesurveyadultdrinkinghabitsingreatbritain/2014\n  [15]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/07/data-2.csv\n  [16]: https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=102\n  [17]: http://flowingdata.com/2016/01/05/causes-of-death/\n\n\n####Footnotes:\n1.

      "markdown": "For seven decades the Office for National Statistics has been using a notional 'Basket of Goods and Services' to help measure the rising and falling cost of products and services over time, known as consumer price inflation.\n\nThis 'shopping basket' contains hundreds of goods and services, with some items taken out of the basket and some brought in to make sure the measures are up to date and representative of consumer spending patterns.\n\nExplore the history of the basket below. Some basket data is missing, so we have only been able to estimate when an item was excluded from the list.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc481/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Basket of goods timeline\"/>\n###How is the Basket of Goods compiled?\nIn principle, the basket of goods and services should contain all consumer goods and services purchased by households and the prices measured in every shop or outlet that supplies them.\n\nIn practice, a sample of prices for a selection of representative goods and services in a range of UK retail locations is used.\n\nCurrently, around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month in compiling the measures, covering around 700 representative consumer goods and services. These prices are collected in around 140 locations across the UK and from the internet and over the phone at ONS.\n\nWithin each year , the consumer price indices represent the changing cost of a basket of goods and services of fixed composition, quantity and quality. In this way, changes in the consumer price indices from month to month reflect only changes in prices, and not ongoing variations in the quality and quantity of items purchased by consumers.\n\nHowever, the contents of the consumer price inflation basket of goods and services and their associated expenditure weights are updated annually. Weights are applied to items to ensure that their influence on the overall measure reflects their importance in the typical household budget.\n\nThis annual updating is important in helping to avoid potential biases that might otherwise develop over time - for example, due to the development of entirely new goods and services, or the tendency for consumers to move away from buying goods and services which have risen relatively rapidly in price and to goods and services whose prices have fallen. For example, if the price of tea rose dramatically during one year, consumers might switch their spending towards coffee making it necessary to adjust the expenditure weights accordingly in the following year.\n###Longer-term trends\nThese procedures also help to ensure that the indices reflect longer-term trends in consumer spending patterns. For example, the proportion of household spending on services has broadly risen overall over the last 25 years. This is reflected both in an increasing weight for this component in the consumer price indices, and the addition of new items in the basket to improve measurement of price changes in this area.\n\nEqually, the weights of education and communication in the CPI have risen since the start of the millennium as university fees have risen and increased use has been made of mobile phones and bundled communication services. Conversely the weights of food and tobacco have fallen.\n\nThere are four different measures of consumer price inflation - the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) which is produced to international standards, CPIH which is a measure of consumer price inflation that includes owner occupier housing costs, the Retail Prices Index (a long-standing measure of UK inflation that has been used for a wide range of purposes), and an improved variant of RPI, called RPIJ, which unlike the RPI uses formulae that meet international standards.\n\nThere are 12 divisions of CPI in the 2016 basket: food & non-alcoholic beverages, alcohol & tobacco, clothing & footwear, housing & household services, furniture & household goods, health, transport, communication, recreation & culture, education, restaurants & hotels and miscellaneous goods & services. These are broken down further into 85 classes, for example, bread and cereals, electricity, new cars and cultural services.\n\nMore technical information about how the Basket of Goods is compiled is available from the [ONS website.][1]\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[Shopping in shops that have no 'shops'][2]\n\n[How do childhood circumstances affect your chances of poverty as an adult?][3]\n\n[Deaths from 'legal highs'][4]\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: <cpi@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/consumerpriceinflationbasketofgoodsandservices/2016\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/articles/shoppinginshopsthathavenoshops/2016-07-29\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/educationandchildcare/articles/howdochildhoodcircumstancesaffectyourchancesofpovertyasanadult/2016-05-16\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/deathsfromlegalhighs/2016-04-28\n  [5]: mailto:cpi@ons.gov.uk\n"

      "markdown": "Arguably the biggest change to shopping in the 20th century was the emergence of supermarkets. For many this made the shopping experience less personal, but as online shopping has become the norm for many in the 21st century, shopping has, to some, become even less personal; in 2008 just 5p of every £1 spent in shops was spent online – by 2015 this had risen to 13p.\n\n####Percentage of all spending in shops that was spent in online shops, Great Britain, 2008 and 2015<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc352/chart1/ch1/chart1.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of all spending in shops that was spent in online shops, Great Britain, 2008 and 2015\"/>\n###But where are people shopping online?\n####Spending in online shops broken down by shop type, Great Britain, 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc352/dvc352/chart2/Donut/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Spending in online shops broken down by shop type, Great Britain, 2015\"/>[Download the data][1]\n\nSo, nearly half of every £1 spent in shops online in 2015 was spent in online stores that have no permanent physical presence on the high street or out of town shopping park. These shops might have a stall sometimes in a market or fair, but that’s it. This is not a blip – it’s actually a growing trend – up from 41p of every £1 spent in shops online in 2010.\n\n####Amount of every £1 spent in shops online that is spent in shops with no physical shop, 2008 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc352/dvc352/chart3/Vertical-Bar-Chart/vertical_bar_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Amount of every Â£1 spent in shops online that is spent in shops with no physical shop, 2008 to 2015\"/>[Download the data][2]\n###So what does this mean for British shopkeepers?\nWell, considering that nearly 88% of all shopping in Great Britain in 2015 was done in physical stores it’s clear that the British public are not ready quite yet to move to an exclusively online shopping experience. However, it could be that some shop types will become more online focused than others in the future, as it does seem that there are some items we are more willing to buy online than others.\n\nLooking at physical shops that also have an online presence, only 4p of every pound spent in shops mainly selling food was spent online, whereas 12p of every pound spent in clothing stores was spent online and 11p of every pound spent in department stores.\n\nThis might have something to do with delivery and returns. When ordering food to be delivered you have to ensure you are at home for the delivery – this is not so for clothing items. Also, it can be difficult and time consuming to return food but lots of clothing stores have made it free and very easy to return their products by making it possible to drop packages off at the corner shop for example, or using lockers in supermarkets.\n\n####Percentage of sales for each shop type made online and in-store, Great Britain, 2015 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc352/dvc352/chart4/Stacked-Bar/stackedbar/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of sales for each shop type made online and in-store, Great Britain, 2015Â�\"/>[Download the data][3]\n###The November effect on online shopping\nOne of the most intriguing trends over recent years has been growth of online shopping in November.  There is a spike in our overall spending in online shops in that month.\n\nIn 2008, 6% of all shopping in November was carried out online, rising to 16% in November 2015.\n\nWhile people spend more overall online and in store in December than November, the advent of online sales events like [Cyber Monday][4], which take place in November, and the increasing convenience of online shopping, has seen people seemingly using online buying as a chance to get organised early for Christmas.\n\n####Percentage of all spending in shops that was spent in online shops by month (non seasonally adjusted), 2008 to 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc352/dvc352/chart5/line_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of all spending in shops that was spent in online shops by month (non seasonally adjusted), 2008 to 2016\"/>[Download the data][5]\n\n\n\n####Notes\n\n\nAll statistics here are based on retail sales excluding spending on fuel.\n\nRetail is divided into the following sectors:\n\n- food stores – these are supermarkets, specialist food stores and stores that sell alcoholic drinks and tobacco (summarised as “Shops that mainly sell food” here)\n- department stores\n- textiles, clothing and footwear stores (summarised as “Clothing shops” here)\n- household goods stores, such as those selling electrical items and furniture\n- other stores, such as those selling jewellery, toys, sporting goods and books\n- non-store retailing, which includes retailers with no physical stores, mail order, catalogues and market stalls.\n\nAll statistics here are based on retail sales excluding spending on fuel.\n\n\n\nFor more information e-mail us at: <retail.sales.enquiries@ons.gov.uk>\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[What's in the Basket of Goods?][7]\n\n[Two Decades of Sunday Trading][8]\n\n[How Popular is Your Birthday?][9]\n\n \n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/07/data-5.csv\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/07/data-4.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/07/data-3.csv\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Monday\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/07/data-6.csv\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/whatsinthebasketofgoods70yearsofshoppinghistory/2016-07-21\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/articles/twodecadesofsundaytrading/2016-03-09\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/articles/howpopularisyourbirthday/2015-12-18\n"

      "markdown": "The UK is consuming less energy than it did in 1998 and more of the energy we are consuming is coming from renewable sources.\n\nHowever, at the same time, the decline in North Sea oil and gas production has meant the UK has become increasingly dependent on imports of energy.\n\nBut just how dependent are we? How do we compare to our European neighbours? And what are we importing and where is it coming from?\n###UK energy: consumption down and renewable energy up\nThere was a 17% fall in the amount of energy used by the UK between 1998 and 2015.\n\nThis may be explained by:\n\n- the increased use of energy-efficient technologies by households and firms\n- government policies designed to reduce energy consumption\n- a decline of UK manufacturing, especially in energy-intensive industries\n\n####Total energy consumed by the UK^1^, 1998 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc357/Fig1/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Total energy consumed by the UK^1^, 1998 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][1]\n\nAt the same time, the percentage of energy coming from renewable and waste sources (such as wind, hydro power and [biomass][2]) has risen from 1% of total UK energy consumption to 9%.\n\n####Percentage of total energy consumed by the UK that comes from renewable or waste sources, 1998 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc357/Fig2/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of total energy consumed by the UK that comes from renewable or waste sources, 1998 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][3]\n###Reliance on imported energy rises back up to 1970 levels\nDespite the overall fall in UK energy consumption and the increasing use of renewable and waste sources, the UK’s reliance on imported energy has returned to the levels last seen around the mid-to late-1970s.\n\nIn recent years our reliance on imported energy has been on an upward trend but it has now fallen from its recent peak in 2013.\n\n####UK energy import dependency: the percentage of UK energy supply made up of net imports^2^, 1970 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc357/Fig3/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK energy import dependency: the percentage of UK energy supply made up of net imports^2^, 1970 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][4]\n###All EU countries now import more energy than they export\nAll EU countries imported more energy than they exported in 2014. In terms of rankings, of the 28 EU countries the UK was the [12th most dependent][5] on foreign sources of energy; less reliant than Germany and Italy but more reliant than Sweden and the Netherlands.\n\nFurthermore, in 2014 the UK’s import dependency was below the EU average and the UK was the least dependent on foreign sources of energy out of the five EU countries who consumed the largest amounts of energy overall (namely Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the UK).\n\nHowever, even though the UK's reliance on imported energy is still below its EU neighbours, the UK is now more in line with them than it has been in recent history.\n\nSince 1998 the UK has gone from being a net exporter to a net importer of energy while Germany, Spain, France and Italy have all consistently imported more energy than they exported.\n\n####Import dependency in the EU: percentage of energy supply made up of net imports for the EU’s five biggest energy consumers and the EU average, 1998 to 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc357/Fig4/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Import dependency in the EU: percentage of energy supply made up of net imports for the EUâ€™s five biggest energy consumers and the EU average, 1998 to 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][6]\n###From oil and natural gas from Norway to coal and diesel from Russia - just where do our energy imports come from?\nIn 2015 the UK’s main types of imported fuel were crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products (for example, petrol and diesel). We also imported electricity and coal and other types of solid fuel (like wood) in smaller amounts.\n\n####Energy imported into the UK by energy type, 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc357/Fig5/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Energy imported into the UK by energy type, 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n\n#####Crude oil imports \n\nIn 2015 a third of the UK’s fuel imports were crude oil and half of these crude oil imports came from Norway.\n\n#####Countries the UK imported crude oil from, 2015 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc357/Fig6/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Countries the UK imported crude oil from, 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][8]\n\nNorway is a key import partner for crude oil due to the pipeline network that runs between Norway and the UK.\n\nHowever, the proportion of imported crude oil coming from Norway has fallen in recent years. Instead more is coming from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ([OPEC][9]) which is made up of Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. In 2015, 36% of crude oil imports came from these countries.\n\n####Natural gas imports\n\nNatural gas made up around 29% of the UK’s fuel imports in 2015 with Norway again being a key import partner for this type of fuel.\n\n####Countries the UK imported natural gas from, 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc357/Fig7/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Countries the UK imported natural gas from, 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][10]\n\nMost of the gas we import comes through pipelines laid underneath the sea bed. We have established pipelines with Norway and the Netherlands which accounted for 61% and 7% of our 2015 gas imports respectively. We also have established pipelines with Belgium but gas imports from Belgium only accounted for 0.4% of our 2015 gas imports.\n\nThe remaining gas imports came to the UK as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) with LNG from Qatar making up 29% of the UK’s gas imports in 2015.\n\n####Imports of petroleum products (for example, petrol, diesel, jet fuel etc)\n\nPetroleum products made up 27% of our fuel imports in 2015 which came from many different countries around the world – the top three were Russia, Sweden and the Netherlands^3^.\n\n####Countries the UK imported petroleum products from, 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc357/Fig9/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Countries the UK imported petroleum products from, 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][12]\n\nTraditionally the UK has exported more petroleum products than it has imported but the closure of the [Coryton][13] and one of the [Milford Haven][14] refineries has lead to a reduction of UK exports of petroleum products. Consequently in 2013 the UK imported more of these products than it exported for the first time since 1973.\n\nIn 2015 the UK imported 9.5 million tonnes more petroleum products than it exported – the highest since the miners’ strike in 1984 which caused the UK to import petroleum products for power generation.\n\n####Imports of coal and other solid fuels\n\nCoal and other solid fuels made up 10% of the UK’s energy imports in 2015 with Russia being our biggest import partner for these types of fuel.\n\n####Countries the UK imported coal and other solid fuels from, 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc357/Fig8/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Countries the UK imported coal and other solid fuels from, 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][15]\n\nMost of the coal the UK imports is used for electricity generation. The other main type of solid fuel the UK imports is wood.\n\n####Electricity imports\n\nIt might seem strange but the UK does actually import electricity that is created elsewhere. Imports of electricity made up 1% of our fuel imports in 2015.\n\nThis electricity is imported via [interconnectors][16] and it comes mainly from France and the Netherlands.\n\nFor more information, please contact: <environment.accounts@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/08/UK-energy-Data-1.csv\n  [2]: http://www.biomassenergycentre.org.uk/portal/page?_pageid=76,15049&_dad=portal\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/08/UK-energy-Data-2.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/08/Uk-energy-Data-3.csv\n  [5]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&plugin=1&language=en&pcode=tsdcc310\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/08/UK-energy-Data-4.csv\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/08/UK-energy-Data-5.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/08/UK-energy-Data-6.csv\n  [9]: http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/08/UK-energy-Data-7-1.csv\n  [11]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/462359/Oil_diversity_2014.pdf\n  [12]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/08/UK-energy-Data-8-petrol.csv\n  [13]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-18239627\n  [14]: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/11209454/The-UK-is-losing-one-of-its-seven-oil-refineries-Milford-Haven.html\n  [15]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/08/UK-energy-Data-9-1.csv\n  [16]: http://www.nemo-link.com/the-project/what-is-an-interconnector/\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1. Energy consumption is measured in million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) – this is a unit of energy defined as the amount of energy released by burning one million tonnes of crude oil.\n2. These import dependency figures show the proportion of a country’s total energy supply that is made up of net imports of energy, where net imports are the total amount of energy imported minus the total amount of energy exported. A negative percentage indicates a country exports more energy than it imports and a positive percentage indicates a country imports more energy than it exports – the higher the percentage the more reliant a country is on foreign energy sources.\n3.

For example, India had a population almost four times the size of the USA in 2012, yet didn’t win a single gold while the USA came back with 46.\n\nHowever, USA success could be because it sent 530 athletes to the games, compared with India’s 83. There are other factors at play in determining medal success at the Olympics.\n\nOne factor which may be linked with medal success is the size of a country’s economy; a richer country would be in a better financial position to support a team of athletes.\n\nExplore for yourself the link between the top 30 medal-winning countries in Rio 2016 and the strength of their economies, by looking at their [GDP][1].\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc354/Rio/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The top 30 medal-winning countries in Rio 2016 and the strength of their economies\"/>\n\n[Download the GDP data.][2]\n\nYou can compare this with the top 30 medal-winning countries in London 2012 and the strength of their economies.\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://onsvisual.github.io/dvc354/London/index.html\" full-width=\"false\"/>\n\n[Download the GDP data.][3]\n\nIn which sports did these countries win gold medals?

In 2015 it had risen even higher - to stand at number six.\n\nSimilarly, while Frederick and Alfred have fallen down the rankings, Freddie stood at number 17 in 2015, up from number 96 in 2004 (when it first came into the top 100) and Alfie stood at number 14 - up from number 92 in 1997 (when it first came into the top 100).\n\n####Rank of comeback names for boys that have returned in a shortened or nickname form for every ten years between 1904 and 1994 and for every year from 1996 onwards\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc363/babyindex_noheader.html#0,Charles,Charlie,Frederick,Freddie,Alfred,Alfie\" full-width=\"false\"/>\n\nThe comeback trend has not been so strong for girls’ names.\n\nThe only 1904 top 20 name to make it back into the top 20 in 2015 is Lily (it stood at 20 in 1904 and 13 in 2015).\n\nAlice (which stood at 8 in 1904) made it back up to 18 in 1994 but stood at 24 in 2015.\n\nFlorence, Elsie, Ivy and Violet have all made somewhat of a comeback into the top 100 but they have not reached the heights of their early 20th century popularity.\n\n####Rank of comeback names for girls for every ten years between 1904 and 1994 and for every year from 1996 onwards\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc363/babyindex_noheader.html#1,Alice,Florence,Elsie,Ivy,Violet,Lily\" full-width=\"false\"/>\n###The disappearing acts\nGladys, Doris, Hilda and Ethel were all in the top 20 in 1904 but they have all, at some point, disappeared from the [full list of names][1] given to baby girls since 1996 (the first year the full list of names given to three or more babies is available).\n\nDon't write them off just yet though - they may be making a comeback - there were six baby girls named Gladys in 2015, another six named Hilda, 13 named Doris and 22 named Ethel.

      "markdown": "The release of the latest [official data][1] on baby names is likely to raise the subject of the [popularity of the name Muhammad][2] once more.\n\nThe latest data shows that Muhammad was the 12th most popular name given to baby boys in 2015.\n\nIt also shows that Mohammed and Mohammad were in the top 100 as well – standing at 29 and 68 respectively, while Muhammed was just outside the top 100, at 121.\n###Combining spelling variations changes the name at the top<br>\nThe ONS treats all names separately by publishing the names of babies as they are written on their birth certificates and ranking them accordingly.  This has been our longstanding approach and it is consistent with international practice.\n\nIn the past [it has been reported][3] that Muhammad is the most popular name for baby boys – however this is often because people have combined the various spellings of Muhammad.\n\nBut combining spellings of one particular name distorts the list – for example combining Sophie, Sophia and Sofia on the 2015 girls list would knock Amelia off the top spot.\n\n####Number of baby girls named Amelia, Sophie, Sofia or Sophia and Sophie, Sofia and Sophia combined, England and Wales, 2015  \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc363/fig3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Number of baby girls namedÂ� Amelia, Sophie, Sofia or Sophia and Sophie, Sofia and Sophia combined, England and Wales, 2015 Â�\"/>\n\nSo to make a fair comparison either all names should be treated separately or all names on the list should be combined with names that have a similar spelling. For example, Martin should be combined with Martyn and Isobelle with Isobel and Isabelle and Ollie with Olly and Oli and Olli etc.\n\nIf the latter approach was taken it would make the lists look very different. But it would also require subjective decision-making about whether certain names are distinctive or not – for example it would raise issues such as whether or not we should combine Sara with Sarah and Anna with Ana - some people pronounce these names the same way, but other people do not.\n\nThe task would be a complex and enormous one – using 2015 data it would involve over 27,000 different boys' names and over 35,000 different girls' names.\n###The name Mohammed ranked at 91 in 1924<br>\nThe appearance of Mohammed in the top 100 is not such a new phenomenon – the first time this name entered the top 100 was in 1924 when it ranked as the 91st most popular name for baby boys. This was not a blip as the name has featured in the top 100 most popular names for baby boys every ten years from 1924 to 1994 and every year since 1996.\n\nDifferent spellings have joined it in the top 100 in more recent years, but three spellings of the name were also in the top 100 in 1954.\n\n####Rank of Mohammed, Mohammad, Muhammad and Mohamed in England and Wales for every ten years between 1904 and 1994 and for every year from 1996 onwards\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc363/babyindex_noheader.html#0,Mohammed,Mohammad,Muhammad,Mohamed\" full-width=\"false\"/>\n###Why are Muhammad/Mohammed/Mohammad rising up the rankings?\nWe do not have a definitive answer for why the variations of the name Muhammad have generally risen up the rankings over time, but there are some possible explanations.\n\n####1. The increasing size of the Muslim community in England and Wales\n\nThe number of people identifying as Muslim on the Census for England and Wales increased from 1.5 million (3% of the population) in 2001 to 2.7 million people (5% of the population) in 2011.\n\n####2. The dominance of the name in the Muslim community combined with increased diversity in names for baby boys\n\nBetween 1996 and 2015 there was a 66% increase in the number of different names given to baby boys, from 16,817 different names to 27,870 different names.\n\nBut in the Muslim community the name Muhammad or one of its variations is very dominant as it is traditional to name baby boys after the prophet of Islam out of [respect and honour for him][4].\n\nThe combination of these two things is likely to be part of the reason we have seen Muhammad/Mohammed/Mohammad rise up the rankings.\n\n####3. The possible increased dominance of the name in the Muslim community\n\nIt is possible that an increasing number of Muslims living in England and Wales are naming their baby boys Muhammad/Mohammed/Mohammad.\n\nThis may be to remind them of their heritage as they grow up in a non-Muslim country.\n\n####4. The possible effect of popular sporting figures with the names Muhammad and Mohamed\n\nMuhammad Ali and Mohamed (Mo) Farah may have played a role in increasing the popularity of the name.\n\n\n\n####Other visual.ONS articles:\n\n[How religion has changed in England and Wales][5]<br>\n\n[Baby names since 1904: How has yours performed?][6]\n\n\n\n####Notes\n\nYou can [download][7] the top 100 names given to baby boys and girls for every ten years from 1904 to 1994.<br>\nYou can also download the count and rank of the names given to three or more baby [boys][8] and [girls][9] from 1996 to 2015.<br>\nYou can also access the data from the statistical bulletins on baby names given to [boys][10]  and [girls][11] from 1996 to 2015.\n\n\n\nFor more information on baby names data, please contact: <vsob@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/babynamesenglandandwales/2015\n  [2]: https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/01/muhammad-truth-about-britains-most-misunderstood-baby-name\n  [3]: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2725724/How-Muhammad-popular-baby-boys-England-Wales-doesn-t-official-list-ways-spell-it.html\n  [4]: https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/01/muhammad-truth-about-britains-most-misunderstood-baby-name\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/religion/articles/howreligionhaschangedinenglandandwales/2015-06-04\n  [6]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/baby-names-since-1904-how-has-yours-performed\n  [7]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/baby-names-data-download-1904-to-1994/\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/baby-boys-1996-to-2015-rank-and-count.csv\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/baby-girls-1996-to-2015-rank-and-count.csv\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/babynamesenglandandwalesbabynamesstatisticsboys\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/datasets/babynamesenglandandwalesbabynamesstatisticsgirls\n"

      "markdown": "Over the next few weeks students will be travelling to university for the start of the academic year. Understanding student populations and the impact they have on an area is complicated by many factors, but what can ONS data tell you about students in the UK?\n###Student numbers have almost doubled since 1992\n####Young people aged 18 to 24 in full-time education, seasonally adjusted, UK, March to May 1992 to May to July 2016\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc366/chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Young people aged 18 to 24 in full-time education, seasonally adjusted, UK, March to May 1992 to May to July 2016\"/>[Download the data][1]\n\nIn the period March to May 1992, there were 984,000 people aged 18 to 24 in full-time education. In May to July 2016, there were 1.87 million, approximately 1 in every 3 people, aged 18 to 24 in full-time education.\n\nLooking at the employment rate amongst this group you can clearly see students gaining employment during the holidays. Students in 2016 are less likely to be in employment than 20 years ago, with on average 35.4% having a job in June to August 2015 to May to July 2016 compared with 40.3% in the same period 20 years previously. However, those that do have a job are more likely to keep it throughout the entire academic year, this is reflected by the fact that the peaks and troughs in the data are less pronounced in 2016 than they were 2 decades ago.\n\n####Percentage of 18 to 24 year olds in full-time education who are in employment, non-seasonally adjusted, UK, March to May 1992 to May to July 2016\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc366/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of 18 to 24 year olds in full-time education who are in employment, non-seasonally adjusted, UK, March to May 1992 to May to July 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][2]\n\n###Inward and outward migration is likely to be greater around larger universities\nMany of the local authorities that contain leading [Russell Group][3] universities, have a peak of people moving into the area at age 19 – when students tend to start their studies. Typically there is also a smaller but similar peak of people moving out of the area at age 22 when students typically finish university.\n\nLooking at the percentage of in and out migration by local authority you can see common patterns in those that have a major university compared with those without.\n\n####Average annual projected migration in and outflows (internal, cross-border and international moves), England, 2014 to 2024\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc366/chart3and4/russell.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Average annual projected migration in and outflows (internal, cross-border and international moves), England, 2014 to 2024\"/>\n\n[Download the data][4]\n\nInternal migration of students and graduates is likely to influence the economic structure of an area; young people in rural areas may move away from their local authority to gain a university education elsewhere. However, once their student life comes to an end they may choose not to return, perhaps due to a lack of career prospects or forming a relationship with someone who lives elsewhere. This may cause a reduced skills base in some local authorities without universities. In London there are many universities and there is perceived to be a much larger and more varied graduate labour market, this may contribute to inward migration at ages 18 to 22.\n\nAs well as the changes in overall population, a large student population within a local authority may influence the overall birth rate in that area, as students in higher education tend to have a below average birth rate.\n\n####Average annual projected migration in and outflows (internal, cross-border and international moves, England, 2014 to 2024\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc366/chart3and4/non-russell.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Average annual projected migration in and outflows (internal, cross-border and international moves, England, 2014 to 2024\"/>\n\n[Download the data][5]\n\nLocal authorities that neighbour those with Russell Group universities are likely to show similar but opposite peaks in migration. People aged 19 move out of the area whilst people move into the area aged 22. This is likely to be due to students moving away to university and returning 3 years later.\n\nIt’s important to highlight that these projected migration figures are also influenced by international, cross-border and non-student internal migration. London areas in particular are affected in these ways. Use the interactive chart to select a local authority and look at how population turnover varies throughout England.\n\nThree different areas – urban, rural and student, are looked at in more detail in this article on [understanding projected population change in an area][6].\n###The aged 18 to 24 population in Oxford and Cambridge increases by over 80% during university term-time\n####Age profile of the usually resident and out of term population: Oxford, 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/github/dvc366/chart5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Age profile of the usually resident and out of term population: Oxford, 2011\"/>\n\n[Download the data][7]\n\nThe population of an area can vary at different times throughout the year, placing different requirements on the provision of services locally. In Oxford in 2011, there was a 12% increase in the overall population and an 83% increase in the 18 to 24 year old population during term-time compared with out of term-time.\n###The male to female ratio can change in areas with universities during term-time\n####Sex ratio in and out of term time, Runnymede, 2011\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/fct5_genderatio_no_heading.png\"/>][8]\n\nIn 2011, during university term-time in Runnymede there were 87 men aged 16 to 24 for every 100 women in the same age group. Out of term-time, the number of men in this age group increases to 99 per 100 women. This may be because Royal Holloway College (part of London University) is in Runnymede. It has a strong reputation for Arts and Humanities subjects which have traditionally attracted more female students.\n\nStafford, and Charnwood in Leicestershire, also experience fluctuations in sex ratios aged 16 to 24, with 18 and 13 less men per 100 women respectively out-of-term time than in term-time. The presence of Staffordshire and Loughborough Universities nearby could be a factor as both have a reputation for courses that may attract a greater number of male students.\n###International student numbers have fallen and are at their lowest since 2007\nOver a quarter of immigrants come to the UK for formal study. In 1977, there were 29,000 international students, rising to a peak of over 8 times this amount in 2010. However, recent years have seen a decline in long-term immigrants arriving to study, with numbers falling to 164,000 in the year ending March 2016.\n####Long-term international immigrants arriving for formal study, UK, 1977 to year ending March 2016\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc366/chart6/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Long-term international immigrants arriving for formal study, UK, 1977 to year ending March 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][9]\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n[What are migration levels like in your area?][10]\n[UK energy: how much?

      "markdown": "World Car Free Day (22 September) aims to encourage people to be less dependent on their cars and make more use of walking, cycling or public transport.\n\nEmissions from cars and other vehicles contribute to [climate change][1] by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. They also contribute to emissions of other pollutants such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide, the latter contributing to [smog and acid rain][2].\n\nTo mark World Car Free Day, we’ve come up with 5 facts about cars.\n###1. Cars were the most used mode of daily transport in 2014\nWhen people in the UK were asked what kind of transport they used most often on a typical day, more than half (57%) reported using a car. A fifth (20%) used urban public transport, while walking was the third most common mode of daily transport (14%).\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-01.png\"/>][3]\n[Download the data][4]\n###2. In 2014, more than 40% used cars for journeys of less than 2 miles that could just as easily be walked\nOver two-fifths (42%) of people in Great Britain in 2014 agreed with the statement: ‘Many of the journeys of less than 2 miles that I now make by car I could just as easily walk’.\n\nMaking short journeys by car causes more pollutants as catalytic converters designed to reduce these pollutants do not work effectively on trips under 5 miles.\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-02.png\"/>][5]\n[Download the data][6]\n###3. In the past 20 years the number of petrol cars on the road has decreased, while diesel cars have increased\nBetween 1994 and 2014,  the number of petrol-driven cars in Great Britain decreased by 5% while diesel cars increased by 581%.\n\nThis may be due to a tax cut on diesel fuel in 2001 and a reduced vehicle tax for all cars with low carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which encouraged motorists to trade in their petrol cars for diesel vehicles.\n\nOver the same period in the UK, petrol consumption has decreased by 46% (11.7 million tonnes of oil equivalent) and diesel use has increased by 75% (10.7 million tonnes of oil equivalent).\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-03.png\"/>][7]\n[Download the data][8]\n###4. The principal air pollutant emissions from car engines have decreased over the last quarter of a century\nBetween 1990 and 2014, the 2 major air pollutant emissions from car engines, namely carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide have fallen by 91% and 76% respectively in the UK.\n\nThis was probably due to the introduction of catalytic converters fitted to cars in the early 1990s to reduce pollutants from car exhausts.\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-04.png\"/>][9]\n[Download the data][10]\n###5. Over a quarter of households do not own a car in Great Britain\nIn Great Britain, between July 2012 and June 2014, almost half of households (46%) owned a car and a further 27% of households owned 2 or more cars, while 27% of households did not own a car.\n\nCar ownership varies across Great Britain:\n\n- 51% of households in the South West owned 1 car\n\n-  36% of households in the South East owned 2 or more cars\n\n- 39% of households in London did not own a car\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-05.png\"/>][11]\n[Download the data][12]\n\n\n\nMore in the 'Five facts about ...' series:\n\n[Five facts about ...housing][13]\n\n[Five facts about...strikes][14]\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: [Environment.Accounts@ons.gov.uk][15]\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.dft.gov.uk/vca/fcb/cars-and-carbon-dioxide.asp\n  [2]: http://www.dft.gov.uk/vca/fcb/cars-and-air-pollution.asp\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-01.png\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/FACT-1.xlsx\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-02.png\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/FACT-2.xlsx\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-03.png\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/FACT-3.xlsx\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-04.png\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/FACT-4.xlsx\n  [11]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-05.png\n  [12]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/FACT-5.xlsx\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/articles/fivefactsabouthousing/2016-08-17\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/workplacedisputesandworkingconditions/articles/fivefactsaboutstrikes/2016-08-12\n  [15]: mailto:Environment.Accounts@ons.gov.uk\n"

      "markdown": "The most recent estimates gathered by the Office for National Statistics from more than 23,000 firms suggest that the output of the services sector – which accounts for three quarters of the economy – grew strongly in July 2016 - up 0.4% from June 2016.\n\n\n\nWhile ONS always warns against focusing too much on month-on-month growth rates, this fresh data on the service sector^1^ tends to support the view that there has been no sign of an immediate shock to the economy, following the vote to leave the European Union, although the full picture will continue to emerge.\n\nAlongside [today’s release][1], here are five key things you need to know about the UK service sector and its importance to the UK economy.\n\n(Please note that the GDP data used here is consistent with the second estimate of GDP published on 26th August)\n###1. 79% of UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) came from the service sector in 2013\nThis has increased from 46% in 1948. Over the same period the share of GDP from production and agriculture has decreased, while the share of construction has remained broadly unchanged.\n\n####Percentage of GDP coming from the services, production, agriculture and construction sectors, UK, 1948 and 2013^2^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc370/servicesector_1/Stacked-Bar-Horizontal/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of GDP coming from the services, production, agriculture and construction sectors, UK, 1948 and 2013^2^\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][2]\n###2. The percentage of workers in the service sector rose from 33% in 1841 to 80% in 2011\nTaking a look at census data for England and Wales, the nature of the labour market has changed considerably over the last 170 years. In 1841 most people worked in manufacturing, but by 1881 those working in services overtook manufacturing. By 2011, around 80% of workers were in the service industry and around 10% in manufacturing.\n\n####Percentage of the labour force working in each sector of the economy, England and Wales, 1841 to 2011 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc370/servicesector_2/WaT_chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of the labour force working in each sector of the economy, England and Wales, 1841 to 2011Â�\"/>\n\nNote: The data used here is for every 10 years since 1841, excluding 1941 and 1971. There was no census recorded in 1941 and information for 1971 is not included due to inconsistent industrial classification.\n\n[Download the data.][3]\n###3. The service sector dominates London's economy\n91% of London’s economy is in the service sector, higher than all other areas of the UK.\n\n####Percentage of each area’s economy that is in the service sector, UK, 2014\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/figure-3.jpg\"/>][4]\n\nSource: [Regional Gross Value Added (income approach)][5], ONS\n\n[Download the data.][6]\n###4. The UK's economy is more reliant on the service sector than any other G7 country\nWhile our reliance is similar to that of France and the USA, we differ from Germany where a lower proportion (69%) of GDP came from the service sector in 2014.\n\n####Percentage of each country's GDP that comes from the service sector, G7 countries, 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc370/servicesector_4/stackedbar/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of each country's GDP that comes from the service sector, G7 countries, 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n###5. The service sector has driven the economic recovery since the downturn in 2008\nFour main sectors feed into UK GDP - agriculture, construction, production and services. Out of these, the service sector was the first to recover after the economic downturn in 2008.\n\n####Output from the service, construction and production sectors in index numbers (2008 = 100), January to March (quarter 1) 2008 to April to June (quarter 2), 2016^3^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc370/servicesector_5/line_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Output from the service, construction and production sectors in index numbers (2008 = 100), January to March (quarter 1) 2008 to April to June (quarter 2), 2016^3^\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][8]\n\nTo consider the growth of a sector over time, index numbers are used instead of volume or value figures. The index number for services was at 111.2 in April to June 2016, up from 100 in January to March 2008 – this means the service sector grew 11.2% over this period.\n\nIn comparison, the index numbers for the production and construction sectors in April to June 2016 were 92.6 and 97.9 respectively. As these are less than 100, it means the output for these sectors has not yet returned to their pre-downturn levels.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: <ios.enquiries@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n\nMore in the 'Five facts about ...' series:\n\n[Five facts about ...housing][10]\n\n[Five facts about...strikes][11]\n\n[Five facts about...cars][12]\n\n\n\n####Notes:\n\nWhenever we have referred to UK GDP in this article we have referred to the [output measure][13] of UK GDP.

The service sector is made up of service activities in retail, hotels, restaurants, transport, storage, IT, finance, insurance, real estate, administration and support services, professional, scientific and technical services, education, health, social work, arts, entertainment, recreation, public administration, defence etc.\n2. GDP figures get revised as additional data becomes available - when looking at how much GDP came from a particular sector in more recent years we use GDP weights from 2013 as at this point the data is less prone to revisions from additional data.\n3. We have not included the index numbers for agriculture on this chart as agriculture makes up a very small part of the UK economy."

      "markdown": "We’re living longer and we’re working for longer too. To mark the [International Day of the Older Person ][1](today), we have five facts which show the impact of those aged 65 and over on the UK workplace:\n\n###1. The proportion of those aged 65 and over who work has almost doubled since records were first collected\nThere were 10.4% (1.19 million) aged 65 and over in employment in the period for May to July 2016. In the same period for 2006, 6.6% (609,000) of the 65+ population had a job.\n\nIn March to May 1992 (when records first began), just 5.5% (478,000) were in employment.\n\n####Employment rate for people in the UK aged 65+, March to May 1992 to May to July 2016\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/Older-people-at-work-1.jpg\"/>][2]\n[Download the data.][3]\n###2. There were 742,000 men and 448,000 women aged 65 and over in employment in the UK in May to July 2016\nThis compares with 301,000 men aged 65 and over in employment for March to May 1992 (when records first began) and 177,000 women during the same period, according to the [Labour Force Survey][4].\n\nA possible factor contributing to the rise in employment among people aged 65 and over could be legislation which stopped employers from compulsorily retiring workers once they reached 65. [This came into force in October 2011.][5]\n\n####Number of males and females aged 65 and over in employment in the UK, March to May 1992 to May to July 2016\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/Older-people-at-work-2.jpg\"/>][6]\n[Download the data.][7]\n###3. Part-time self-employed workers tend to be older than part-time employees\nThe 65 and over age group accounted for 22% of all part-time self-employment in 2015, up from 14% in 2001.\n\nAlmost half of those aged over 70 in employment were self-employed, in 2015 (49.13%). In 2001 it was nearer a third (39.68%).\n\n####Age distribution of part-time employees and the part-time self-employed, 2001 and 2015\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/Older-people-at-work-3.jpg\"/>][8]\n[Download the data.][9]\n###4. The economy may come to rely increasingly on older workers by 2039\nUnder exisiting legislation, the number of people of State Pension Age (SPA) and over is projected to increase by 32.5% from 12.4 million in mid-2015 to 16.5 million by mid-2039.\n\nThis reflects the higher number of people who were born in the 1960s ‘baby boom’ reaching State Pension Age within the 25 year period to mid-2039.\n\nOver the same period, the number of people of working age (age 16 to SPA) is projected to rise by 10.3% from 40.4 million in mid-2015 to 44.6 million by mid-2039.\n\nThe number of people of pensionable age for every thousand people of working age (the Old Age Dependency Ratio) was steady at around 300 from the 1980s to 2006, but rose in 2007-09 as women born in the post-World War II baby boom reached SPA.\n\nIn the absence of any increases to SPA, it would reach 487 by 2039; but, as a result of planned SPA increases taking place between 2010 and 2046 under current legislation, it is expected that – for every 1,000 people of working age in 2039 – there will be 370 people of SPA.\n\nThe increase in the OADR means there will be fewer people of working age to support a larger population over SPA.\n\n####Old age dependency ratio (OADR), UK, 1980 to 2039\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/Older-people-at-work-4.jpg\"/>][10]\n[Download the data.][11]\n###5. The working world for people aged 65 and over is similar to those aged 16 to 64\nSix industries are responsible for just over 60% of the employment of both age groups.\n\n####Percentage of those aged 16 to 64 and 65 and over in work, by industry, UK, 2011 Census\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/Older-people-at-work-5.jpg\"/>][12]\n\n[Download the data.][13]\n\nFor more information, please contact: <digital.content@ons.gov.uk>\n\nIf you like our visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up ][15]to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n\nMore in the 'Five facts about...' series:\n\n[Five facts about ...housing][16]\n\n[Five facts about...strikes][17]\n\n[Five facts about...cars][18]\n\n[Five facts about...the service sector][19]\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.un.org/en/events/olderpersonsday/index.shtml\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/Older-people-at-work-1.jpg\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/Old-people-1.csv\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/surveys/informationforhouseholdsandindividuals/householdandindividualsurveys/labourforcesurveylfs\n  [5]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15127835\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/Older-people-at-work-2.jpg\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/old-people-2.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/Older-people-at-work-3.jpg\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/Old-people-fact-3.csv\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/Older-people-at-work-4.jpg\n  [11]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/old-people-4.csv\n  [12]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/Older-people-at-work-5.jpg\n  [13]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/Old-people-5.csv\n  [14]: mailto:digital.content@ons.gov.uk\n  [15]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n  [16]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/articles/fivefactsabouthousing/2016-08-17\n  [17]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/workplacedisputesandworkingconditions/articles/fivefactsaboutstrikes/2016-08-12\n  [18]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/fivefactsaboutcars/2016-09-22\n  [19]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/articles/fivefactsabouttheukservicesector/2016-09-29\n"

But this has now changed – households with a breadwinner aged 60 or over are actually the ones with the highest income these days.\n\nHowever, households with breadwinners in their 20s are technically better off (materially speaking) now than back in the mid-80s. If we apply 2015 prices to 1986, a household with a 20 something breadwinner back then was living on £17,029 whereas these days they live on £25,378.\n\nBut when we consider how today's young breadwinners are doing, we must also consider the following:\n\n###1. Housing costs: \n\nThe figures here, while accounting for inflation, do not include [housing costs][2]. This is important as these have risen greatly over this period - often much above the rate of inflation.\n\n###2. More young people are living at home:\n\nA household with a 20 something breadwinner is a rarer thing these days than in the past as there has been an increase in the number of people aged 20 to 34 living with their parents.\n\n####Number of young adults aged 20 to 34 living with their parents, UK, 1996 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc315/chart1/line_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Number of young adults aged 20 to 34 living with their parents, UK, 1996 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3].\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[How has the student population changed?][4]\n\n[What's the best time for a wedding?][5]\n\n[Five facts about...housing][6]\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: <hie@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/incomes-new.csv\n  [2]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/uk-house-price-index-data-downloads-july-2016\n  [3]: http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc315/chart1/line_chart/data.csv\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/articles/howhasthestudentpopulationchanged/2016-09-20\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/marriagecohabitationandcivilpartnerships/articles/whatsthebesttimeforawedding/2016-08-26\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/articles/fivefactsabouthousing/2016-08-17\n\n\n\n####Footnotes:\n1. The average used in this analysis is the median. Disposable income is after direct taxes (such as Income Tax) and National Insurance, but before housing costs. Disposable income is equivalised to account for households of different size. The household breadwinner is the Chief Economic Supporter of the household who contributes most to household income. Only non-retired households are included here - these are households where the combined income of non-retired members amounts to more than half the total gross income of the household. 2014/15 means financial year ending March 2015 and the data is adjusted for inflation based on March 2015 National Accounts data."

      "markdown": "As Jane Austen (almost) said: it is a truth universally acknowledged that men (generally) get paid more than women.\n\nBut do they get paid more than women for doing the same work? That is harder to answer.\n\nThe data published today in the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) will give us the most up-to-date information on the pay gap between men and women.\n###The gender pay gap has fallen but remains steady in recent years\nThe gender pay gap for full-time employees in 2016 was 9.4%\n\nThis means average pay for full-time female employees was 9.4% lower than for full-time male employees. This gap is down from 17.4% in 1997.\n\nThe gap for all employees (full-time and part-time) has reduced from 19.3% in 2015 to 18.1% in 2016. This gap is down from 27.5% in 1997.\n\n####Gender pay gap over time, by full-time and part-time work, UK, 1997 to 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc374/GPG_chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Gender pay gap over time, by full-time and part-time work, UK, 1997 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][1]\n###Reasons for the gap\nThe main factors explaining why women tend to earn less than men are:\n\n- part-time work\n- type of occupation\n- having and caring for children\n\n###Part-time work\n####Percentage of men and women who work part-time, UK, April to June 2016\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/Gender-Pay-Gap.png\"/>][2]\n\nSource:[ Labour Force Survey][3]\n\nPart-time workers – both men and women – earn less, on average, per hour than their full-time counterparts.\n\nA much higher proportion of women work part-time – 41%, compared with only 12% of men. This is why the gap for all employees – full-time and part-time together – is higher than for full-time employees\n\nInterestingly, the gender pay gap for part-time employees alone was minus 6.0% in 2016. This means female part-time employees earned 6.0% more than male part-time employees.\n###Occupation\nAnother factor that affects the gender pay gap is that women tend to work in occupations which offer lower salaries. The size of the gender pay gap also varies between occupations.\n\nThe chart below shows a higher proportion of women than men working in sectors such as administration and caring, which tend to be lower paid.\n\n####Percentage of male and female employees in different occupational groups, UK, April to June 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc374/GPG_chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"PercentageÂ� of male and female employees in different occupational groups, UK, April to June 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][4]\n###Having and caring for children\nWhen looking at the differences in pay by age group for full-time employees, the gap is relatively small up to and including those aged 30 to 39.\n\nFrom 40 upwards, the gap is much wider. This is likely to be connected to women taking time out of the labour market to have children.\n\nTaking full-time and part-time employees together, for all age groups from 22 to 29 upwards, the gap is wider than for full-time employees alone. This indicates that, in these age groups, more women are working part-time in jobs that tend to be lower paid.\n\n####Gender pay gap by age group, UK, April 2016^1^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc374/GPG_chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Gender pay gap by age group, UK, April 2016^1^\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][5]\n\nHaving children may also change [what women want from a job][6]. The American economist [Claudia Goldin][7] sees women pursuing “temporal flexibility” as “perhaps the most powerful explanation for the gender pay gap”. What this means is women are more likely to want the ability to work flexible hours, or to work at home, or to complete a project outside a tight schedule.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: <earnings@ons.gov.uk>\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[Breadwinners in their 20s – how are they doing compared with previous generations?][9]\n\n[Does our sex affect what we die from?][10]\n\n[How do the richest countries perform in the Paralympic Games?][11]\n\n\n\n\nIf you like our visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up ][12]to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/chart1.csv\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/Gender-Pay-Gap.png\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/october2016\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/chart2.csv\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/chart3.csv\n  [6]: http://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-true-story-of-the-gender-pay-gap-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/\n  [7]: http://scholar.harvard.edu/goldin/home\n  [8]: mailto:earnings@ons.gov.uk\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/articles/breadwinnersintheir20showaretheydoingcomparedwithpreviousgenerations/2016-10-11\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/doesoursexaffectwhatwediefrom/2016-07-13\n  [11]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/how-do-the-richest-countries-perform-in-the-paralympic-games/\n  [12]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n\n\n####Footnotes:\n\n1.

      "markdown": "Although the value of the pound has been falling for some time, the vote to leave the European Union has had a big effect in recent months.\n\nThe pound fell in value against many other foreign currencies on June 24 when the referendum result was announced and fell again in the beginning of October, following further announcements about Brexit.\n\n####How the value of the pound compares to its value on the day the date for the EU referendum was announced, January 2016 to October 2016\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc373/dvc373/Chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"How the value of the pound compares to its value on the day the date for the EU referendum was announced, January 2016 to October 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][1]\n\nA preliminary estimate of 0.5% growth in GDP in July to September 2016, was accompanied by a rise in the value of the pound yesterday (October 27, 2016).\n\nThe pound is widely traded on international markets which means its value can fluctuate on a daily basis.\n\nSince the referendum there have been falls in demand for the pound influenced by:\n\n- a cut in interest rates – all else being equal, this could  cause investors to move their money into other countries that may  pay them a higher return\n- expectations from some commentators for  lower growth and higher inflation in the UK - which could make investing here less attractive\n\n###But what does this mean for people in the UK?\nIf you've been on an overseas holiday this year you will have probably noticed that your money didn't go as far as it may have done in the past, but, aside from this, how else could the fall in the pound affect the UK economy and therefore, you?\n###Price rises\nA fall in the value of the pound will increase the price of goods and services imported into the UK.\n\nIn recent weeks there have been reports of [iPhones][2], [Microsoft Office][3] and even [model trains][4] going up in price as a result of the fall in the pound.\n\nEven so, it is difficult to predict how changes in the value of the pound will feed through to the overall price level. There are many factors that could delay the effect (such as supermarkets buying stock in advance) and some businesses may choose to absorb the higher costs rather than pass them onto consumers.\n\nIn the most recent data we published, inflation (as measured by the Consumer Prices Index) rose by 1.0% in the year to September 2016.\n\nHowever, inflation has been on an upward trend since late-2015 and when analysing the cause of this month's rise, Head of Inflation Mike Prestwood said:\nThere is no explicit evidence the lower pound is pushing up the prices of everyday consumer goods.\n####UK headline rate of inflation (as measured by the Consumer Prices Index), January 2008 to May 2016 (12 month percentage change)\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc373/Chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK headline rate of inflation (as measured by the Consumer Prices Index), January 2008 to May 2016Â� (12 month percentage change)\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][5]\n\nHowever, there is evidence that the fall in the pound has led to increased costs for businesses that import their production inputs - for example metal, equipment and oil.\n\nThe most recent data on input producer prices shows that they rose 7.2% in the year to September 2016.\n\n####Rate of change in input prices for businesses, UK, September 2012 to September 2016 (12 month percentage change)\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc373/Chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Rate of change in input prices for businesses, UK, September 2012 to September 2016 (12 month percentage change)\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][6]\n###Higher export sales could increase growth, employment and living standards\nA fall in the pound means that UK exports will be cheaper for customers in other countries to buy. This should help UK companies increase the amount of goods and services they sell to the rest of the world which would bring more money into the UK – potentially increasing employment, growth and therefore living standards.\n\nBut there are a range of factors that affect the sale of UK exports, such as:\n\n- how well UK companies are set up to exploit export markets – for example, it can take time for a business to adapt its processes to sell overseas and find profitable opportunities where potential customers will demand its goods\n- the economic conditions in other countries – if other countries are in an economic downturn they will not have the money to spend on our goods\n- how sensitive the demand for our exports is to price – for example we export Rolls Royce cars but the demand for these is not very sensitive to price changes as they are a luxury item. This means the number sold may not significantly change as the price changes\n- the trade arrangements that exist to access markets across the world\n\nThe UK has long had success when it comes to exporting services, especially financial services. However, less success has been found in more recent years when it comes to exports of manufactured goods.\n\nWe have limited data on how export sales have performed following the fall in the pound, but it will be interesting to see what happens to this data in coming months.\n\n####The percentage of UK output (Gross Domestic Product) coming from the exports of goods and services\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc373/Chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The percentage of UK output (Gross Domestic Product) coming from the exports of goods and services\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n###More visitors to the UK and a rise in the staycation?\nA fall in the value of the pound makes it cheaper for overseas visitors to come here and spend money, and more expensive for UK residents to visit places abroad.\n\nThis could mean if you opt for a 'staycation' over a holiday abroad, you may find the queues that bit longer and the traffic that bit more congested!\n\nBut again, there are many factors that can affect tourism.\n\nFor example, there has been an upward trend in the number of people visiting the UK since late 2012, but this has not been driven by the value of the pound, which had also been on an upward trend until earlier this year.\n\nInstead, the increase in visitors has been largely driven by a rise in the number of visitors from Europe, including countries that recently joined the EU. There have also been large proportional increases in visitors from China and other emerging economies who now have the money to travel further afield.\n\n####Visits to the UK, seasonally adjusted, 2006 to 2016 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc373/Chart5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Visits to the UK, seasonally adjusted, 2006 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][8]\n\nFurthermore, nothing yet suggests that 'staycations' have risen in popularity. The number of UK residents travelling abroad has continued to rise in line with the trend seen since the economic downturn in 2008.\n\nThis may be because there is no evidence (at this stage), to show a fall in the pound has had an effect on air fares or the prices of package holidays.\n\n####UK residents' visits abroad, seasonally adjusted, 2006 to 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc373/Chart6/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK residents' visits abroad, seasonally adjusted, 2006 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][9]\n\nThere is some evidence that the fall in the pound has attracted tourists on shopping sprees for luxury goods - good news if your livelihood is connected to these businesses! In July, sales of watches and jewellery were up 16.6% on the year and there was anecdotal evidence suggesting that the weaker pound was encouraging overseas visitors to buy more goods.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: <macro@ons.gov.uk>\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[Breadwinners in their 20s – how are they doing compared with previous generations?][11]\n\n[How is the welfare budget spent?][12]\n\n[Five facts about… the UK service sector][13]\n\n\n\n\nIf you like our visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up ][14]to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/data-download.csv\n  [2]: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/09/08/brexit-makes-iphone-7-and-airpods-more-expensive-in-uk-as-apple/\n  [3]: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brexit-microsoft-prices-rise-pound-slump-value-software-impact-a7378181.html\n  [4]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37755137\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/CPI-for-pounds-article.csv\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/PPI.csv\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/exports.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/tourism.csv\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/tourism.csv\n  [10]: mailto:macro@ons.gov.uk\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/articles/breadwinnersintheir20showaretheydoingcomparedwithpreviousgenerations/2016-10-11\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/articles/howisthewelfarebudgetspent/2016-03-16\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/articles/fivefactsabouttheukservicesector/2016-09-29\n  [14]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n"

      "markdown": "The UK is ranked 6th out of the seven countries that form the G7 (a group of large developed economies) for healthcare expenditure as a proportion of [Gross Domestic Product][1] (GDP).\n\nONS’s new internationally-comparable \"[health accounts][2]\"^1^ show that the UK’s total healthcare spending in 2014 was £179 billion, or 9.9% of GDP. \n\nAs a percentage of GDP, the UK spent less on healthcare than USA, Japan, France and Germany and a similar percentage to Canada. The USA spent the most on healthcare as a percentage of GDP at 16.6%.\n\nOut of the G7 group of countries, only Italy spent a smaller percentage of GDP on healthcare (9.1%) than the UK in 2014.\n\nHowever, all G7 nations, including the UK, spent a higher proportion of GDP on healthcare than the average of 9% for OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries.\n\n####Current healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP for G7 countries, 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc375/fig1/stackedbar/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Current healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP for G7 countries, 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data][5].\n\n###Healthcare spending and life expectancy\nAmong OECD countries, life expectancy tends to be longer in countries that spend more per person, on healthcare, however, this is not always the case.\n\nWhile the USA outspent the UK on healthcare (£6,311 and £2,777 per person^2^ These figures have been adjusted for difference in purchasing power. Purchasing power parities (PPPs) are the rates of currency conversion that equalise the purchasing power of different currencies by eliminating the differences in price levels between countries.\n\nAll spending per capita figures in this article have been adjusted for difference in purchasing power respectively) in 2014, average life expectancy at birth in the USA was 78.8, compared with 81.4 in the UK.\n\nDespite spending, by far, the largest amount on healthcare, the USA was among the 10 OECD countries with the lowest life expectancy.\n\nA [range of factors][6] can influence life expectancy including social influences, socio-economic factors, and spending on healthcare.\n\nWithin the G7 group of countries, Japan spent the fifth most per person on healthcare and had the highest life expectancy, while Italy spent the least per person and had the second highest life expectancy. France and Germany spent more per person on healthcare than the UK but only France had a higher life expectancy.\n\n####Life expectancy at birth and current healthcare expenditure, per person for OECD member-states (current PPPs), 2014 \n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc375/fig5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Life expectancy at birth and current healthcare expenditure, per person for OECD member-states (current PPPs), 2014Â�\"/>\n\n[Download the data][7].\n\n###How is healthcare paid for?\nThe way healthcare is funded differs across the globe. In G7 countries healthcare is mostly financed either directly through government financing (for example through taxation) or through mandatory social insurance schemes. In the UK, healthcare expenditure was principally financed through government revenues (79.5% in 2014) - also the main source of spending in Italy and Canada.\n\nGermany, Japan and France have healthcare systems financed primarily through social health insurance, which is compulsory health cover to ensure access to healthcare, either for the whole population or for specific population groups.\n\n####Share of current healthcare expenditure by financing scheme for G7 countries, 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc375/fig3/stackedbar/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Share of current healthcare expenditure by financing scheme for G7 countries, 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data][8].\n\nThe USA is the only G7 country where less than half of healthcare expenditure is financed through government or compulsory insurance schemes. Instead, the USA’s healthcare system relies more heavily on private funding, notably from private health insurance, which makes up 34% of healthcare spending.\n\nPrivately financed healthcare was a much smaller component of healthcare spending in the UK, accounting for around one-fifth of total expenditure.\n\nThe largest component of this type of spending in the UK was household out-of-pocket spending - direct purchases of healthcare services and products made by individuals. This included spending on pharmaceuticals, medical equipment (such as prescription eyewear) and contributions to long-term care.^3^\n\nOut-of-pocket spending was also the most substantial component of private healthcare expenditure for Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada.\n\nPrivate health insurance accounted for 3.6% of total healthcare expenditure in the UK – much less than in France and Canada, where it represented a much larger proportion of healthcare expenditure. In these countries private insurance was used to supplement public coverage.\n\n####Government/compulsory and private/voluntary healthcare expenditure for the UK and USA (£ per head), current PPPs, 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc375/fig4/Cluster_Horizontal/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Government/compulsory and private/voluntary healthcare expenditure for the UK and USA (Â£ per head), current PPPs, 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data][9].\n\nDespite less than half of the USA’s total healthcare expenditure coming from government expenditure or compulsory insurance schemes, it still spends more per person on these financing schemes than the UK- £3,111 in the USA in 2014, compared with £2,210 in the UK. In the USA spending on privately-funded healthcare is over five times more per person than in the UK.\n###What types of healthcare do countries spend their money on?\nIn each of the 10 largest economies in the European Union, the largest category of healthcare expenditure was spent on curative/rehabilitative care, such as hospital operations, GP consultations and emergency care.\n\nIn the UK, 57% of all healthcare spending was on curative/rehabilitative care, while for the remaining largest EU economies this ranged from 60% in Poland to just under half of total healthcare expenditure in Belgium.\n\n####Share of current healthcare expenditure by function of healthcare for the ten largest EU economies, 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc375/fig6a/stackedbar/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Share of current healthcare expenditure by function of healthcare for the ten largest EU economies, 2014\"/>\n\n[Download the data][10].\n\nThe proportion of healthcare expenditure spent on long-term care has been increasing over time in a large number of OECD countries.\n\nIn 2014 the UK spent 18% of total healthcare expenditure on long-term care.\n\nOut of the 10 largest EU economies, northern European countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden and Belgium had the largest proportion of long-term care spending.\n\nBy comparison southern European countries such as Spain and Italy and eastern European countries such as Poland spent smaller proportions of healthcare expenditure on long-term care.\n\nIn these countries, spending on medical goods acquired by patients for treatment outside of a care setting, such as over-the-counter and prescription pharmaceuticals and spectacles, accounted for a greater proportion of healthcare expenditure than in the UK. Spending on medical goods accounted for 22% of total healthcare spending in Spain compared to 15% in the UK and 12% in Sweden.\n\n\n\nYou can read the OECD's [Health at a Glance][11] in full, or, for more information, you can contact: <Healthaccounts@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[Does our sex affect what we die from?][13]\n\n[How has life expectancy changed over time?][14]\n\n[Most affluent man outlives the average woman for the first time][15]\n\n\n\n\nIf you like our visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up ][16]to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13200758\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthcaresystem/bulletins/ukhealthaccounts/2014\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthcaresystem/bulletins/ukhealthaccounts/2014\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthcaresystem/bulletins/ukhealthaccounts/2014#background-notes\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/11/Chart1-Healthcare-expend-as-a-percentage-of-GDP-G7-1-2.xlsx\n  [6]: https://www.oecd.org/health/health-at-a-glance-19991312.htm\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/Chart-2-Life-expectancy-at-birth-v-healthcare-expenditure-2.xlsx\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/Chart3-Share-of-health-expenditure-1-2.xlsx\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/Chart-4-Govt-compulsory-private-healthcare-expenditure-USUK-1.xlsx\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/Chart5-Healthcare-expenditure-UK-USA-2.xlsx\n  [11]: https://www.oecd.org/health/health-at-a-glance-19991312.htm\n  [12]: mailto:Healthaccounts@ons.gov.uk\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/doesoursexaffectwhatwediefrom/2016-07-13\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/articles/howhaslifeexpectancychangedovertime/2015-09-09\n  [15]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/articles/mostaffluentmanoutlivestheaveragewomanforthefirsttime/2015-10-21\n  [16]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n\n\n####Footnotes:\n\n1. ONS recently published the ‘[UK Health Accounts][3]’, for the first time enabling consistent comparisons of UK healthcare expenditure with that of other countries across Europe and fellow member-states of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development).\nUK Health Accounts are internationally-consistent healthcare expenditure statistics, produced according to guidelines published by the OECD. Health accounts provide figures for total healthcare expenditure and analyse this spending by three dimensions:\n- financing scheme – the source of funding for healthcare\n- function – the type of care and mode of provision\n- provider organisation – the type of healthcare provider in which care is carried out\n\nIn order to meet the international definitions used in health accounts, the [definition of healthcare used in health accounts][4] is broader than that used in previous UK healthcare expenditure analyses and includes a number of services which are typically considered as social care in the UK\n\n2._These figures have been adjusted for difference in purchasing power. Purchasing power parities (PPPs) are the rates of currency conversion that equalise the purchasing power of different currencies by eliminating the differences in price levels between countries. All spending per capita figures in this article have been adjusted for difference in purchasing power.\n\n3._Expenditure is classified as long-term care in health accounts where the care is provided with the primary purpose of alleviating pain and suffering and reducing or managing the deterioration of health in patients with chronic conditions, where an improvement in their health is not anticipated."

They also transport themselves or others around - providing 5 hours of transport in a week (almost half their weekly unpaid work) and around an hour a week is spent actively engaging with a child.\n\nIn contrast, the average mother on maternity leave racks up 37 hours of active engagement with their child/children, 8 hours of cooking, 7 hours of housework, 2 hours of laundry and 6 hours of transporting themselves or others around.\n\nVolunteering is the only type of unpaid work that students do more of – providing just under half an hour of volunteering time per week.\n\n####Average hours of unpaid work done per week by students and mothers on maternity leave, UK, 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc376a/chart-3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Average hours of unpaid work done per week by students and mothers on maternity leave, UK, 2015\"/>\n[Download the data][6].\n\nAs a result, the value of their weekly unpaid work also varies massively; £762.75 for a woman on maternity leave, whereas a student does an average of £119.44.\n###Income\nThe figures also revealed that people on lower incomes tended to carry out, on average, more unpaid work than other income brackets, with some exceptions, such as transport.\n\nFor example, those on low incomes spent an average of 5.93 hours per week doing unpaid cooking, compared with 4.98 hours for those on high incomes. Those on low incomes spent an average of 3.78 hours a week doing housework, compared with 3.23 for those on high incomes.\n\nBut those on high incomes provided 7.80 hours of free transport per week, compared with 5.43 hours for those on low incomes.\n\n####Average hours of unpaid work done per week by grouped income level, UK, 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc376a/chart-4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Average hours of unpaid work done per week by grouped income level, UK, 2015\"/>\n[Download the data][7].\n\n\n\n####Unpaid work calculator: How much you could earn if someone paid you to do everyday tasks\n\nHow much work do you do in a week?

Unpaid work is defined as unpaid service work which households perform for themselves but which they could pay someone else to do for them. This work is not paid, and is therefore not captured in official measures of the economy such as GDP. Examples of unpaid work include: unpaid childcare, unpaid adult care, unpaid preparation of meals, unpaid laundry, unpaid transportation of self or others, unpaid housework, unpaid DIY, unpaid gardening or unpaid volunteering."

By 1948 it expanded to cover the national wage bill, private income and [Gross National Product][6].\n\nBy 1952, the Blue Book had incorporated new economic concepts and improved sources and began to resemble the format that we now know.\n\nToday’s Blue Book, which is in its 70th year, is no longer blue and is now in a digital format; it was first produced as a [web-based publication in 2013][7].\n\n\n\n\n- The next quarterly GDP release, is the second estimate and will be published on 25 November.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: <gdp@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[The challenges of measuring GDP in the digital, borderless world][9]\n\n[Why has the value of the pound been falling?][10]\n\n[The gender pay gap - what is it and what affects it?][11]\n\nIf you like our visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up ][12]to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/timeseries/abmi/pgdp\n  [2]: https://visual.ons.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1811-gdp-Seasonally-adjusted-£m-CHART1.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/11/data.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/11/Change-in-GDP-over-time-chart3.xlsx\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/11/BB-scans-page-004-e1479675423811.jpg\n  [6]: http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gnp.asp\n  [7]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa1-rd/united-kingdom-national-accounts/the-blue-book--2013-edition/index.html\n  [8]: mailto:gdp@ons.gov.uk\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/articles/thechallengesofmeasuringgdpinthedigitalborderlessworld/2016-11-22\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/whyhasthevalueofthepoundbeenfallingandwhatcouldthismeanforpeopleintheuk/2016-10-28\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/thegenderpaygapwhatisitandwhataffectsit/2016-10-26\n  [12]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

      "markdown": "The digital economy has transformed the way we do business. However it presents many challenges when it comes to measuring its performance and any change in the behaviour of consumers.\n\nHow do we measure the success of the economy in a rapidly changing world?\n\nONS Fellow and Professor of Economics at the University of Manchester, [Diane Coyle][1] discusses those challenges...\n\n\n\nThinking about Britain’s economy in the late 19th century calls to mind images of grimy cotton mills, mines, canals and railways.\n\nYet in an official Abstract of Statistics, published in 1886, only a dozen out of nearly 200 pages have any information about these symbols of industrialisation. The rest reflect the country’s economic past, dominated by agricultural production and trade.\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/11/6.jpg\"/>][2]\n\nStatistics are bound to lag behind what is happening in the economy when it is changing so rapidly. Statisticians now face a similar challenge to their Victorian forbears because of the effects of digital technologies.\n\nIn fact, there are many challenges. Some are more straightforward to deal with. The collection of data needs to cover new businesses, especially if they are growing quickly, and if they lead to different patterns of behaviour. Ensuring online retail sales (now more than 15% of the total excluding petrol) are included in the figures would be one example.\n\n####Internet Retail Sales (non-seasonally adjusted), UK, January 2007 to January 2016\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc3822/DVC382/gdp/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Internet Retail Sales (non-seasonally adjusted), UK, January 2007 to January 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3]\n\nProviding a service through digital platforms such as Airbnb, and online activities such as providing blogs or open source content, offer different instances of new behaviour, not easily captured in current statistics.\n\nIn theory, the work involved and income made from renting out a spare room this way should be recorded, but might not be.\n\n‘Volunteer’ digital services such as contributing to Wikipedia or open source software are not even counted in principle because they are conceptually similar to cooking at home or volunteering at school – these activities lie outside the ‘production boundary’ that defines [Gross Domestic Product (GDP)][4]. Yet they are probably substituting for services people pay for, such as encyclopedias or proprietary software.\n\nOther challenges are even trickier. In the digital sector all kinds of new activities and jobs are emerging, but these do not fit into the existing classification of sectors, which is heavily tilted towards manufacturing because its origins lie in the late 1930s. People select the classification they think suits their business best, so it is not obvious where newer industries such as video games or software development sit in the statistics.\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/11/1.jpg\"/>][5]\n\nIt is harder to calculate price indices for some new services.\n\nWhile the price of a CD was straightforward to measure, what is the price of a streaming service some people get for free (with advertisements) and others pay for, while some buy the same music as downloads or in physical form still?\n\nWhat is the price of a recorded song or symphony, and is that the right kind of unit?\n\nAnother difficult question about prices – needed to calculate economic growth in real terms as well as the inflation rate – is whether they ought to reflect rapid improvements in quality.\n\nA laptop bought today might be the same price as one bought three years ago but will have far better features such as speed, memory, screen resolution and so on.\n\nStatisticians make adjustments to calculate quality-adjusted prices (or ‘hedonic prices’) for a few items; the question is whether they should cover more goods and services this way, or make the adjustments more comprehensive.\n\nThis is not an easy one to answer, as economists and statisticians have always understood that prices paid in the market never capture all the benefits people enjoy from their purchases.\n\nEconomists un-poetically call this extra value ‘consumer surplus’, but it refers to the longer life enabled by a new medicine, or the joy of being able to speak to a friend or relative far away. If statisticians start to make quality adjustments to prices that take them away from what the purchaser pays, where is the boundary between economic value and joy?\n\nAs if these were not enough, there are (at least) two other big challenges for statistics in the digital economy. Both stem from the way companies’ business models are changing. A growing number of businesses operate as digital ‘platforms’ offering low or zero prices to one set of consumers, subsidized by another set or by suppliers.\n\nFor instance, Google offers free search, maps, emails and so on, and is paid by advertisers. This makes it hard to define the value of any individual element of the service, or the price of the product.\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/11/4.jpg\"/>][6]\n\nWhat’s more, many of the large digital businesses operate globally, and will be headquartered overseas, and might also be registered for tax (and possibly statistical) purposes elsewhere.

      "markdown": "Long-term international migration was a key factor in the EU referendum debate and as the details of how we will leave the EU emerge over the coming years it is likely to remain so.\n\n\nIt wasn’t always this way though. At the start of the 20th century there weren’t even any laws about who could and couldn’t stay in the UK.\n\nBut as the century wore on, modes of transportation developed, living standards rose, war caused displacement and labour shortages, revolutions and political unrest created many refugees, the British Empire came to an end and the UK became an ever more integrated member of the European Union.\n\n[Final 2015 figures][1] published today show that net migration (that is, the number of people coming to live here minus the number of people leaving to live elsewhere) was 332,000 in 2015. While it’s impossible to predict how international migration might change in the future, we can look back in time to see what has affected international migration to and from the UK in the past.\n\n###How has international migration varied since 1964?\n\nExplore this interactive timeline to see topical events and changes that may have had an impact on those entering and leaving the UK.\n\n####Long-Term International Migration to and from the UK, 1964 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc380/timeline/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Long-Term International Migration to and from the UK, 1964 to 2015\"/>\nSource: [Long-Term International Migration and International Passenger Survey, ONS][2]\n\n\nThe reasons why people have left or entered the UK to start new lives over the last century are complicated and varied. Increased living standards, developments in transport and work opportunities in the UK combined with global displacement due to war have all influenced UK international migration.\n\nThere has also been a shift away from the British Empire and Commonwealth – who used to have the same citizen status as British nationals – to an inclusive European community where members have freedom of movement across the EU.\n\n###Who is coming and going from the UK?\n\nChanges in initiatives, policies and laws over the years have not only influenced the number of people moving to and from the UK, but also the nationality of those moving.\n\nIn 2015 there were 332,000 more people entering the UK than leaving the UK. This number includes British citizens; such as those British citizens returning from living or working abroad or British citizens born abroad and returning to the UK.\n\nHistorically there have always been more British citizens leaving the UK than entering, therefore net migration of British citizens has been negative.\n\n####Long-Term International Migration to and from the UK by British citizens, 1964 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc380/charts/chart2/Bar-and-Line/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Long-Term International Migration to and from the UK by British citizens, 1964 to 2015\"/>\n[Download the data][3].\n\nThe current government ambition is to cut overall net migration, which has mainly been driven by changing levels of immigration, to \"sustainable levels\".\n\nNon-EU citizens continue to account for a slightly larger share of immigration, compared with EU citizens. However the gap is narrowing with recent larger increases seen for EU immigration and decreases for non-EU immigration.\n\nNon-EU citizens made up 44% of all immigrants in 2015, a reduction from the highest proportion of non-EU immigrants (69%) seen in 2002.\n\n####Long-Term International Migration to and from the UK by non-EU and EU citizens, 1975 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc380/charts/chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Long-Term International Migration to and from the UK by non-EU and EU citizens, 1975 to 2015\"/>\n[Download the data][4].\n\nEU immigration has also increased over recent years and one of the contributing factors has been immigration from the EU8 and EU2 countries which peaked at 112,000 in 2007 for EU8 citizens and 65,000 in 2015 for EU2 citizens.\n\n####Long-term International Migration to and from the UK by EU15, EU8 and EU2 citizens, 1975 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc380/charts/chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Long-term International Migration to and from the UK by EU15, EU8 and EU2 citizens, 1975 to 2015\"/>\n[Download the data][5].\n\n\n\nMore information on migration estimates for the UK is available [here][6].

But you can also [explore the gender pay gap and test your knowledge][1] using the latest data from the 2017 Annual Survey of Earnings and Hours. \n\nOne of the ongoing talking points in the workplace and government is the difference in pay between men and women. In her first [statement as Prime Minister][2], Theresa May highlighted that:<br>\n\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: none; padding: 25px 25px 25px 65px; margin: 25px 0;  position: relative; background: #F2F2F2 url('https://visual.ons.gov.uk/wp-content/themes/ons-datastories/assets/img/quote.png') no-repeat 20px 25px;\"><p style=\"    margin-bottom: 0;\"><strong>\"If you’re a woman, you will earn less than a man.\"</strong></p></blockquote>\n\nAddressing this inequality in pay is one of the government’s aims. Last year's consultation marked the start of [Closing the Gender Pay Gap][3] ensuring that \"women achieve their full potential and the productivity of the nation is improved\".\n\nThe pay gap impacts on some of the most recognisable faces in society. While Theresa May is likely earning the same as her predecessor David Cameron, the same cannot be said of people in other occupations.\n\nIn the last year, actress [Jennifer Lawrence expressed anger][4] at the large variation in earnings in her industry, while in the tennis world, [Serena Williams][5] highlighted the difference in her pay compared to male equivalents.\n###But just how large is the difference?\nOne of the widest gender pay gaps is in financial occupations. Our Annual Survey of Earnings and Hours (ASHE) full-time hourly pay data shows, for example, that male financial managers and directors earn 32.4% more than women in the same occupation.\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/12/GPG-formula.png\"/>][6]\nThe Gender Pay Gap (GPG) is the primary measure used when comparing differences in pay between men and women. It is calculated using hourly pay (excluding overtime) for full-time employees.<br>\n\nOf course this is an average figure and there is quite a bit of variation within this occupation in terms of pay.\n\nThe average gap in pay between men and women in the UK is 9.4%.

It can differ depending on whether you are looking at full-time or part-time working (or both), what age you are, what ethnicity you are and your seniority within an occupation. For example there may be a wider (or narrower) GPG in those earning a higher salary as an actor than in those earning a lower salary.\n\nIt’s also important to consider the ratio of men to women in each occupation and whether any difference is due to one gender being disadvantaged in this field or whether they are just naturally more or less inclined go into that type of work.\n\nThe reasons for the gender pay gap are complex and overlapping:\n\n- girls do well at school but often choose occupations or sectors that offer narrower scope for financial reward - many of the highest paying sectors are disproportionately made up of male employees.\n\n- a proportion of the gap may be due to the negative effect on wages of having worked part-time or having taken time out of the labour market to look after family.\n\n- women may not progress in work at the same rate as men due to cultural attitudes, lack of flexible working and stereotyping.\n\n- some older women may need to learn new skills to take advantage of employment opportunities in growing sectors; others may have increased caring responsibilities for partners, grandchildren or ageing parents.\n\n\nMore information on ASHE is available [here][9]. \n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/11/218px-Government_Equalities_Office_Logo.png\"/>][8]\n\n####Other Visual.ONS articles\n[Find out the gender pay gap for your job][11]<br>\n[Women shoulder the responsibility of ‘unpaid work’][12]<br>\n[The gender pay gap – what is it and what affects it?][13]<br>\n\nIf you like our visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up ][14]to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n  [1]: https://visual.ons.gov.uk/explore-the-gender-pay-gap-and-test-your-knowledge/\n  [2]: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-from-the-new-prime-minister-theresa-may\n  [3]: https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/closing-the-gender-pay-gap\n  [4]: http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/?u=a5b04a26aae05a24bc4efb63e&id=64e6f35176&e=1ba99d671e#wage\n  [5]: http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/serena-williams-reignites-gender-pay-gap-debate-says-female-tennis-players-deserve-equal-pay-1569568\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/12/GPG-formula.png\n  [7]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2016provisionalresults/relateddata\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/11/218px-Government_Equalities_Office_Logo.png\n  [9]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2016provisionalresults\n  [11]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/find-out-the-gender-pay-gap-for-your-job\n  [12]: https://visual.ons.gov.uk/the-value-of-your-unpaid-work/\n  [13]: https://visual.ons.gov.uk/the-gender-pay-gap-what-is-it-and-what-affects-it/\n  [14]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

      "markdown": "London households’ average weekly spending is one and-a-half times more than households in the North East of England, latest data from the ONS shows.\n\nAt £652.40, households in London spent the most each week, on average, of all the UK countries and regions, while households in the North East spent the least at £423.50.\n\nAverage weekly spend in London was between £40 and £228 more than any other country and region, the figures, using data from the last three financial years, show.\n\nAcross the UK, the average weekly household expenditure for the last three full financial years was £527.20.\n\n\n\nHow much do you think your household spends every week?\n\nTake a look at our regional spending interactive tool and see how it compares with the rest of the UK:\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc389/barcodeplot/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Family Spending\"/>\n\nSource: [Family Spending in the UK, Financial Year Ending March 2016][1]\n\n[Download the data][2]\n\n\n\nThe interactive shows that average weekly spending differs across the UK, particularly when it comes to housing costs.\n\nSpending on housing accounts for the bulk of the difference between London and the UK countries and regions.\n\nFor example, in the financial year ending 2016, an average renter in London spent £167.10 a week on net rent. This is an increase on the previous financial year (figures not adjusted for inflation) where average spending stood at £159.10 and is more than three times the amount spent in 2016 by renters in the North East (£46.30) and Northern Ireland (£44.60).\n\nThe ONS’s [Family Spending][3] release highlights the different spending patterns that households have in other regions.\n###Alcohol and Tobacco\nData from the last three financial years showed spending on alcoholic drinks and tobacco varied across the UK. Households in [Scotland][4] spent the most on alcoholic drinks, with an average of £8.90 a week; 1.8% of Scotland households’ total expenditure.\n\nThis was partly driven by expenditure on spirits and liqueurs, where Scottish households spent an average of £2.70 a week, compared with the UK average of £1.70\n\nIn contrast to this, London households spent 1.1% of their total expenditure on alcoholic drinks. The ethnic diversity of London may contribute to the low levels of spending on alcohol in this region.\n\nExpenditure on tobacco is even more varied across the UK. The average weekly spending on cigarettes for England was £2.90, Wales £3.00, Scotland £4.90 and Northern Ireland £6.60.\n\n####Food and Non-Alcoholic Drinks\n\nNorthern Ireland and the South East spent more on food and non-alcoholic drinks than any other UK country or region at £64.20 per week - £14.60 more than the North East, where households spent the least.\n\nNorthern Ireland households spent more on tea, bread, buns and cakes than any other UK country and region, while the South East spent the most on cheese.\n\nLondon households spent the most on fresh fruit and fresh vegetables (£4.50 and £5.50) per week, while the North East households spent the least (£2.50 and £3).\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc389/barcodeplot_exp/index.html#.L/Fresh%20fruit/Fresh%20vegetables\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Food and Non-Alcoholic Drinks Northern Ireland and the South East spent more on food and non-alcoholic drinks than any other UK country or region at Â£64.20 per week - Â£14.60 more than the North East, where households spent the least. Northern Ireland households spent more on tea, bread, buns and cakes than any other UK country and region, while the South East spent the most on cheese. London households spent the most on fresh fruit and fresh vegetables (Â£4.50 and Â£5.50) per week, while the North East households spent the least (Â£2.50 and Â£3).\"/>\n\n\nHowever, the North East spent more on food and non-alcoholic drinks as a percentage of total spending than London – at 12% to the capital’s 10%.\n\nCommunication is the only category of spending where the percentage of total expenditure does not vary at all between regions – at 3%.\n\n\n\nThere are plenty more fascinating facts about household spending habits across the UK regions.

      "markdown": "A quarter of neighbourhoods^1^ in England and Wales were off-limits to many prospective homeowners last year because average income in these areas was below the level needed to buy an entry-level property^2,3^.\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/02/housing_ancore.png\"/>][2]\n\n\n\nAccording to analysis of ONS data, the cost of an entry-level property on average across England and Wales has increased by almost 20% in the last decade, to £140,000. For new properties, the price was nearly £180,000. The data suggests^4^ that home-ownership prospects varied across the country.\n\nThose in England who succeeded in making it onto the property ladder in 2016 paid on average more than £198,000^5^. Would-be homeowners in London faced more of an uphill climb, with the average value paid by first-time buyers over £423,000.\n\nFirst-time buyers entering the property market typically purchased homes for more than the average entry-level house price where they live. This was the case in all English regions and in Wales, showing that those who did manage get onto the property ladder for the first time could actually afford more than the cost of an entry-level property.\n\nHowever, this doesn’t reflect those people who couldn’t afford to buy their first home. Assuming a 15% deposit^6^, new buyers in London could require a household income of nearly £60,000 and savings of £55,000, challenging for many.\n\nA typical household in England and Wales could need an income of £26,444 in order to borrow enough for an entry-level property, however this figure varied greatly within regions.\n\n####Price of an entry level property in English regions and Wales compared with what was actually spent by first-time buyers\n\nYear ending June 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc393/chart1/Simple-Bar-Horizontal/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Price of an entry level property in English regions and Wales compared with what was actually spent by first-time buyers Year ending June 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][7]\n\n###What areas were the most and least affordable?\nSome of the least affordable areas were in London. In general these areas were estimated to have higher than average household income, but house prices were significantly higher than in other regions of England and Wales. A neighbourhood in Wandsworth, London, for example had an estimated average annual household income of £89,223, but the estimated income required for an entry-level property was £127,689.\n\nThe most affordable neighbourhoods were generally in the north of England and parts of Wales. Many of the neighbourhoods in these areas had relatively low average income, but had more affordable housing.\n\nLondon and its surrounding neighbourhoods had some of the most extreme gaps between average income and the income required to buy property, but relatively unaffordable areas were by no means limited to the city.\n\nEntry-level properties across much of the south coast of England could be relatively unaffordable for households on average income. The Foxholes neighbourhood in Poole for example had an average household income of just under £35,000, but the income required to buy an entry-level property was just under £40,000.\n\nParts of Oxfordshire and its neighbouring counties also had a large number of relatively unaffordable areas. The Littlemore neighbourhood in the city of Oxford had an average household income just over £39,000 but the income required to buy an entry-level property was over £45,000.\n\n###The associated costs of moving home \nA deposit, stamp duty, legal fees and other associated moving costs are all considerations when buying a home, requiring many first-time buyers to have substantial savings or other sources of funding such as from parents. The recent [Government Housing White Paper for England][8] set out ways in which first-time buyers will be supported in saving for a deposit, such as through the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (ISA) which offers a 25% bonus on top of savings towards the purchase of a first home.\n\nWith the average cost of an entry-level home in England and Wales being £140,000, prospective buyers could require £300 stamp duty, an estimated £2,000 for legal and moving costs and £21,000 for a 15% deposit, coming to £23,300 in total.\n\nThe savings needed to purchase an entry-level property varied disproportionately to house prices between different areas. Stamp duty on more expensive properties can add thousands of pounds on top of a 15% deposit, whereas buyers in areas where an entry-level property costs less than £125,000 are not required to pay any stamp duty.\n\nA neighbourhood in Pendle just north of Burnley, for example, required those buying an entry-level property to have typical savings of £7,625 for a 15% deposit and other costs due to the low cost of an entry-level property. This represents about 3 months’ average income for a household in this area.\n\nIn contrast, buyers in one neighbourhood in Reading could owe stamp duty of £5,375 on an entry-level property, on top of a much larger deposit of £46,125. With other associated fees, buyers in this area could need savings of £53,500. This represents more than one year’s income for an average household in this area, and [other research][9] suggests it could take a lower income household much longer than this to save for a first home.\n\n###Where can you afford to buy your first home?\nUse our affordability calculator for England and Wales to find out what you could need financially to climb onto the property ladder where you live.\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc393/affordabilitycalculator/content.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Can You Afford a House?\"/>\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[London household spending outstrips the rest of the UK][11]\n\n[Breadwinners in their 20s - how are they doing compared with previous generations?][12]\n\n[Five facts about housing][13]\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography\n  [2]: #calculator\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/bulletins/housepricestatisticsforsmallareas/yearendingdecember1995toyearendingjune2016\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/smallareamodelbasedincomeestimates/financialyearending2014\n  [5]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-house-price-index-england-november-2016/uk-house-price-index-england-november-2016\n  [6]: https://www.cml.org.uk/news/press-releases/december-2016-monthly-lending-trends-press-release/?utm_source=CML%20email%20alerts&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=CML%20alerts\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/02/housing-affordability-chart-1-data-download-1.xlsx\n  [8]: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/housing-white-paper\n  [9]: http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/media/blog/dealing-with-the-housing-aspiration-gap/\n  [10]: mailto:better.info@ons.gov.uk\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/articles/londonhouseholdspendingoutstripstherestoftheuk/2017-02-16\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/articles/breadwinnersintheir20showaretheydoingcomparedwithpreviousgenerations/2016-10-11\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/articles/fivefactsabouthousing/2016-08-17\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n\n1.

Australia, Canada and India are among the largest economies in the world, while a number of Asian and African members rank among the fastest-growing.\n\n####UK trade balance with Commonwealth countries, 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc397/scatter_zoom_out/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK trade balance with Commonwealth countries, 2015\"/>\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc397/scatter_zoom_in/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK trade balance with Commonwealth countries, 2015 \"\"\"\"\"\"\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][4]\n\nDespite the distance between the two countries, the UK exported £8.6 billion of goods and services to Australia in 2015, more than any other Commonwealth nation. The strength of this relationship is boosted by tourism between Australia and the UK – travel accounted for more than £1 billion of UK services imports and exports with Australia in 2015.\n\nHowever, India is increasingly becoming the UK’s key Commonwealth trading partner, particularly in terms of imports. The rise in [offshoring and outsourcing][5] in recent years has led to the value of goods and services imported from India rising from £4.4 billion in 2005 to £9.5 billion in 2015.\n\nTrade ties between the UK and the largest Commonwealth nations remain distant compared with close relationships enjoyed with countries in the EU. The UK exported much more to Germany alone (£48.5 billion) in 2015 than Australia, Canada, India, Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore combined (£32.8 billion).\n###What about Africa?\nMore than a third of Commonwealth members are African nations, including giant economies such as South Africa and Nigeria. The UK posted a £1.4 billion trade surplus with African Commonwealth countries in 2015, compared with a £2.9 billion deficit in 2005. Exports have increased by more than 60% over that period.\n\nSouth Africa is the UK’s biggest trading partner among African Commonwealth countries, followed by Nigeria. Together, these two nations made up around 72% of UK trade (exports plus imports) with the African Commonwealth in 2015.\n\nOverall, UK exports to Africa remain strikingly low compared with EU trading. Exports to Germany were more than five times more valuable than exports to all 18 African Commonwealth nations (£9.2 billion) in 2015.\n\n####World trade map explorer\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc390/worldmap/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"World trade map explorer\"/>\n\n[Download the data][6].\n\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[Who does the UK trade with?][8]\n\n[Understanding the UK economy][9]\n\n[Five facts about GDP][10]\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.cweic.org/event/commonwealth-trade-ministers-meeting/\n  [2]: http://thecommonwealth.org/media/news/trade-opportunities-commonwealth-post-brexit\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/03/Total-imports-and-exports-2015.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/03/Total-imports-and-exports-2015.csv\n  [5]: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/15/rbs-to-cut-450-investment-banking-jobs-uk-two-thirds-offshore-india\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/02/Imports-exports-1999-2015.xlsx\n  [7]: mailto:trade@ons.gov.uk\n  [8]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-trade-partners/\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/articles/dashboardunderstandingtheukeconomy/2017-02-22\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/articles/fivefactsaboutgdp/2017-02-17\n"

Between 2000 and 2015 it dropped from an average (mean) of 14.5 minutes per volunteer, per day to 13.7 minutes.\n\nThis equates to a drop from a weekly average of one hour and 42 minutes to one hour and 36 minutes per volunteer.\n###Age and volunteering - The Big Society and Beyond\nThe statistics suggest that those in the youngest age group of 16 to 24 have increased the time they devote to volunteering while those in the 25 to 34 age category have decreased their volunteering time.\n\nIn 2015 average time and participation in volunteering was higher for those aged between 16 and 24 (17 minutes per day and 51% participation) and was a noticeable rise as compared to those in the same age group in 2000 (nine minutes per day and 40% participation).\n\nIt could be that, as younger people try and secure employment, they undertake voluntary work in order to enhance their CVs, but as they embed themselves in their careers, at an older age, their focus turns to building their careers.\n\nAlso, younger people have more free time, with participation rates for students rising the most - by 12 percentage points between 2000 and 2015 – from 46% to 58%.\n\n####Average daily minutes of formal volunteering provided, by age, 2000 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc400/slope/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Average daily minutes of formal volunteering provided, by age, 2000 to 2015\"/>\n[Download the data.][4]\n\nThere have been many incarnations of volunteering schemes, promoted by a succession of governments in the UK.\n\nDavid Cameron’s Big Society initiative led to the launch of the [National Citizen Service][5] in 2011 and has seen more than 300,000 teenagers take part.\n\nHowever, both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s governments promoted citizenship-style volunteering schemes.\n\nBBC Radio One has been running a [Million Hours Campaign][6], started in 2015, aimed at encouraging young listeners to volunteer for good causes.\n###Men vs women\nOverall, women are streets ahead of their male counterparts when it comes to volunteering and when they volunteer, they do so for longer periods of time.\n\nThere was a decline in the number of minutes dedicated to voluntary work for both men and women; from 12.29 per day to 11.29 for men and a drop from 16.30 to 15.65 for women, both between 2000 and 2015.\n\n####Average daily minutes of formal volunteering provided, by gender, UK, 2000 and 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc400/bar/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Average daily minutes of formal volunteering provided, by gender, UK, 2000 and 2015\"/>\n[Download the data.][7]\n\nIn weekly terms, men put in an average of 1.26 hours in 2000, compared with 1.19 hours in 2015.

      "markdown": "The future of UK manufacturing will be in focus when post-Brexit trade negotiations begin. The Prime Minister is due to trigger Article 50 tomorrow, starting the formal process of our exit from the EU.\n\nThe UK economy may be dominated by services nowadays, but manufacturing remains a key part of the policy debate around Brexit and trade.\n\nDespite making up a much smaller proportion of gross domestic product (GDP), goods trade continues to outweigh that in services. Goods accounted for 55% of UK exports and 75% of imports in 2016.\n\nWhat’s more, UK goods producers generally enjoy close trading relationships with EU economies. More than half of UK trade in goods (exports plus imports) was with the EU in 2016. Goods trade with the EU is significant for both UK manufacturers’ sales and supply chains.\n###Does UK manufacturing benefit from EU trade?\nIn short, yes; 47% of UK goods exports went to the EU in 2015. In contrast, just 7% of goods exports from the rest of the EU came to the UK[^1^](#footnote1).\n\nThis imbalance is inevitable given that the UK is just one country trading with a group of 27 other nations. Nonetheless, post-Brexit trade rules will apply to the EU as a collective, not each country individually.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc402/chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Destination of UK goods exports\"/>\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc402/chart1i/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Destination of EU goods exports\"/>\n\nAs well as being the UK’s largest export market, the EU is also the source of vital components in the production process. Around two-thirds of UK imports of semi-manufactured goods come from EU countries. For example, [UK carmakers][1] are highly reliant on components made elsewhere in the EU.\n\nThis highlights the importance of a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. If the UK and EU are unable to reach an agreement, their goods trade could be subject to tariffs and quotas under [World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules][2].\n###Does EU industry want to trade with the UK?\nYes, the UK remains an important partner for individual EU economies. 26 out of the 27 other EU countries exported a greater proportion of their goods to the UK than the UK exported to them in 2015.\n\nAlthough trade between the UK and individual EU nations will be governed by the relationship with the EU as a whole, countries which are dependent on the UK to buy their goods may want to argue the case for a positive trade deal. However, any deal will have to be approved by all 27 members.\n\n####Explore to what extent other countries trade in goods with the UK.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc402/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Explore to what extent other countries trade in goods with the UK.\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][3]\n\n###Where does the UK rank as a goods exporter?\nThe UK exported £288 billion of goods in 2015.

Computing would focus more on building programs and learning to code, rather than learning the basics of using computers, which is what the already-existing ICT GCSE was focused on.\n\nWhile the old ICT GCSE is now being phased out, with the last batch of pupils taking their exams next year, there are concerns that the new Computing GCSE is not popular enough.\n\nThe British Computing Society has [voiced its worry ][1]that a lack of interest in the topic at this level will lead to a shortage of skilled workers in this growing industry in future. The latest figures show that while the number of pupils taking Computing at GCSE is growing, insufficient numbers are signing up to meet future demand in the workforce.\n\n####The number of pupils taking ICT and Computing GCSE exams, 2014 to 2017\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/06/computing-chart.png\"/>][2]\n\n[Source: Ofqual, Summer 2017 Exam Entries, England][3]\n\nAdditionally there appears to be a perception problem among young girls who are seemingly avoiding the new GCSE.\n\nIn 2016 [just 20%][4] of those taking a Computing exam at GCSE level were female, whereas they make up 41% of those taking an ICT GCSE.\n###Computing in the economy\nIT contributed nearly £55 billion to the UK economy in 2016, according to GVA figures. Its contribution has quadrupled since 1990.IT makes up 4% of the UK service economy, 3% of the whole economy.\n\nThe UK is a net exporter of [computer services][5].\n\nWe exported £2.8 billion more than we imported in 2015. Exports of computer services were 74% higher in 2015 than 2005.\n###Jobs\nThe jobs market for ICT and telecommunications professionals has been buoyant for some years and continues to be so.\n\nSince computing was introduced as a GCSE topic, in 2012, there has been a 19% increase in people [in employment][6] in the industry.\n\nThere were 950,000 professionals employed in ICT and telecommunications in the UK in 2016, 3% of the working population (31,661, 000), with an 82% and 18% male to female split.\n\nIn 2012, there were 795,000 people in employment in IT and telecomms, with an 85% and 15% male to female split.\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS publications:\n\n- [Five Facts About the UK Service Sector][7]\n\n- [An Overview of the UK Labour Market][8]\n\n\n\nIf you like our Visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up][9] to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40322796\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/06/computing-chart.png\n  [3]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/summer-2017-exam-entries-gcses-level-1-2-certificates-as-and-a-levels-in-england\n  [4]: http://www.jcq.org.uk/examination-results/gcses/2016\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/datasets/3tradeinservicesthepinkbook2016\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/employmentbyoccupationemp04\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/articles/fivefactsabouttheukservicesector/2016-09-29\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/ukperspectives2016anoverviewoftheuklabourmarket/2016-05-26\n  [9]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n  [10]: mailto:digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk\n"

A high employment rate is an indicator of a strong economy, and wage growth is usually expected.\n\n####See how much your salary would need to rise next year, in order to keep up with the current rate of inflation\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc409/calc/index.html\" full-width=\"false\"/>\n\nNote: This interactive is an illustrative example and should not be used to make financial decisions.\n\nIt is important to note that inflation affects everyone differently - even employees who have the exact same wage growth - as it depends on what items you buy and whether those prices have risen or gone down.\n###Private and public sector employees experience different pay changes\nWhile workers across nearly all industries are experiencing pay growth beneath inflation levels, it differs between industries and sectors.\n\nThe private sector is experiencing pay growth at a higher level than the public sector (2.3% and 1.1% respectively). This means public sector workers are likely to be more affected, on average, as inflation rises.\n\nTo illustrate this, you can look at the fictional examples of Ali and Becca.\n\nAli is in the public sector, and Becca is in the private sector. Both of them earned £28,200 - the [average median salary][2] for full-time employees in the financial year 2015-16. Let's suppose that in April 2017 their pay increased in line with public (1.1%) and private (2.3%) sector pay growth:\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc409/charts/growth/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Pay growth\"/>\nSource: [EARN01: Average Weekly Earnings - Total Pay][3], ONS\n\n*Note: The inflation rate in this chart differs to that in the calculator as it is based on the April 2017 inflation rate whereas the calculator uses the current inflation rate.*\n\n####Total pay growth by industry sector, GB, April 2017\nIn the wholesale, retail, hotel and restaurant industry, pay growth was highest, with growth of 2.6% in April 2017, whereas in the construction industry workers saw their pay increase by 1.0%.\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc409/charts/bar2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Total pay growth by industry sector, GB, April 2017 In the wholesale, retail, hotel and restaurant industry, pay growth was highest, with growth of 2.6% in April 2017, whereas in the construction industry workers saw their pay increase by 1.0%.\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][4]\n###What will the future bring?\nIt’s impossible to predict with certainty what will happen to pay growth in the future, but the Office for Budget Responsibility have forecast that real earnings will not have returned to pre-downturn levels by 2020 to 21, despite record employment and a more skilled workforce.\n\n\n\nNote: Pay growth can be affected by a number of factors other than pay rises. The wage growth figures in this article are from the average weekly earnings (AWE) series, which takes into account money paid to employees before tax and other deductions. The estimates also reflect changes in the mix of high and low earning jobs in the economy, bonuses, changes in the number of paid hours worked and the impact of employees paid at different rates joining and leaving individual businesses. The estimates do not include earnings of self-employed people.\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS publications:\n\n[GDP and me][5]\n\n[Prospective home owners struggling to get onto property ladder][6]\n\n[Why has the value of the pound been falling?][7]\n\n\n\nFor more information, contact: <labour.market@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/06/data.csv\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2016provisionalresults#average-earnings\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/averageweeklyearningsearn01\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/06/data-1.csv\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/articles/gdpandme/2017-03-20\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/articles/prospectivehomeownersstrugglingtogetontopropertyladder/2017-02-24\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/whyhasthevalueofthepoundbeenfallingandwhatcouldthismeanforpeopleintheuk/2016-10-28\n  \n"

The State Pension age is expected to [rise towards 70][2] in the future, so there will be an onus on people to maintain good health until older ages. \n\nThat said, the picture varies significantly by area. For example, boys and girls born in Wokingham in 2013 to 2015 could expect to live 70 years in good health, whereas in Manchester they are only likely to be in good health for 56 years.\n\nWhat are the reasons behind these differences? Which factors have the greatest impact on an area’s healthy life expectancy?\n\n[ONS][3] has taken data from [Public Health England][4] and its own [Annual Population Survey][5] to analyse these impacts in England.\n\n\n\n###Smoking\nDespite falling [popularity][6], smoking remains the primary cause of preventable death in England. Around 79,000, or one in six, deaths were linked to smoking in 2015. \n\nAreas with higher numbers of smokers generally have a lower healthy life expectancy. For example, people in Hull are nearly three times more likely to smoke than in Wokingham. Healthy life expectancy in Hull is around 15 years shorter than in Wokingham for both men and women. \n\nWhat could happen to an area's healthy life expectancy if the number of smokers changed? Move the slider to find out.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc413/sliders/smoking/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Healthy life expectancy - Smoking slider\"/>\n\nHow does this slider work?^1^\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n\nSource: [Annual Population Survey][8], ONS\n###Alcohol\nThe harmful effects of drinking alcohol can be measured using alcohol-related hospital admissions, which are far more common in some areas than others. There were more than 1,200 alcohol-related hospital admissions per 100,000 people in Blackpool, nearly 200 per 100,000 more than anywhere else in England. Neither men nor women in Blackpool are expected to live 60 years in good health. In contrast, there were fewer than 400 admissions per 100,000 people in Wokingham, the lowest in England.\n\nAlcohol-related hospital admissions reflect the underlying harmful drinking behaviour of an area, so tend to be higher in areas with lower healthy life expectancy. What could happen to an area's healthy life expectancy if the rate of alcohol-related hospital admissions changed? Move the slider to find out.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc413/sliders/alcohol/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Healthy life expectancy - Alcohol slider\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][9]\n\nSource: [Public Health England][10]\n###Diet\nMore than half of the English population successfully met the government guideline of five portions of fruit and vegetables per day in 2015.\n\nAreas with a greater percentage of healthy eaters have a higher healthy life expectancy. More than 60% of people living in Rutland, an area in the East Midlands, reported consuming at least five a day in 2015. On the other hand, nearly two in every three Liverpudlians failed to meet the guideline. Healthy life expectancy in Rutland is roughly 13 years longer than in Liverpool.\n\nWhat could happen to an area's healthy life expectancy in the future if the number of people consuming at least five fruit and vegetables per day changed? Move the slider to find out.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc413/sliders/diet/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Healthy life expectancy - diet slider\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][11]\n\nSource: [Public Health England][12]\n###Physical activity\nAs well as maintaining a healthy diet, the government recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week. Examples of moderate exercise include cycling and fast walking. More than half of adults in England (57%) were meeting this guideline in 2013 to 2015.\n\nYork was the most active area in England, with nearly 70% of adults meeting the exercise guideline. Healthy life expectancy is above average at 66 for males and females in York.\n\nMeanwhile, the Olympic legacy is yet to materialise in the London borough of Newham. Despite hosting the Games in 2012, Newham was the least active area for adults in England (less than 45% of adults met the recommendation). People born in Newham in 2013 to 2015 are likely to live only 60 years in good health.\n\nWhat could happen to an area's healthy life expectancy in the future if the number of people meeting the physical activity guideline changed? Move the slider to find out.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc413/sliders/physicalactivity/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Healthy life expectancy - physical activity slider\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][13]\n\nSource: [Public Health England][14]\n\n\n\n###Find out how your area compares with the rest of England in terms of the lifestyle factors previously listed.\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc413/barcodes/barcode/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"HLE Barcode Plots\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][15]\n\n\n###Location matters as well as lifestyle\nOf course, healthy life expectancy depends on more than just lifestyle. For example, deprivation, linked to education and employment, limits access to resources and services necessary for maintaining health. A person’s or family’s disposable income and the area in which they live has a major bearing on how they live their life and their resultant exposure to health risks. \n\nFactors tied to where people live are often outside their control. People generally have little say over where they go to school, but they can decide to quit smoking. \n\nWhere a person lives clearly has a significant impact on their healthy life expectancy. Boys born in England’s wealthiest areas can expect 19 extra healthy years compared with boys in the country’s poorest areas. For girls, this stretches to 20 years.\n\nDeprivation is not spread evenly across the country and therefore helps to explain some of the variation in healthy life expectancy between areas. The North of England represents 30% of the population, but is home to 50% of the poorest areas. Many northern towns and cities – including Hartlepool, Hull, Manchester and County Durham – rank among the lowest in England in terms of healthy life expectancy.\n\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS publications:\n\n[Women shoulder the responsibility of ‘unpaid work’][16]\n\n[How does UK healthcare spending compare internationally?][17]\n\n[How long will you live in good health?][18]\n\n\n\nIf you like our Visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up][19] to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\nFor more information, please contact: <digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk>\n\n####Footnotes:\n\n1. The analysis used in the sliders shows the linear relationships between individual lifestyle factors and healthy life expectancy. It is not suggesting that a person's healthy life expectancy would rise by a certain number of months if they were to give up smoking, for example. Neither does it refer to likely impacts on specific areas. Instead, it shows what might happen, on average, to an area's healthy life expectancy if smoking prevalence across England were to change. It is based on data from 150 local authorities in England.\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/06/HLEvsLE.csv\n  [2]: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/pensions-retirement/financial-planning/state-pension-age-look-up-when-you-will-retire/\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthinequalities/articles/healthrelatedlifestylesandwidercharacteristicsofpeoplelivinginareaswiththehighestorlowesthealthylife/june2017\n  [4]: http://www.phoutcomes.info/\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/search?q=annual+population+survey\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/bulletins/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain/2016\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/06/Smoking.csv\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/search?q=annual+population+survey\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/06/Alcohol.csv\n  [10]: http://www.phoutcomes.info/\n  [11]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/06/Diet.csv\n  [12]: http://www.phoutcomes.info/\n  [13]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/06/Physical-activity.csv\n  [14]: http://www.phoutcomes.info/\n  [15]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/06/All-factors-by-area.csv\n  [16]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/womenshouldertheresponsibilityofunpaidwork/2016-11-10\n  [17]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthcaresystem/articles/howdoesukhealthcarespendingcompareinternationally/2016-11-01\n  [18]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/articles/howlongwillyouliveingoodhealth/2015-11-20\n  [19]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n"

Three in 10 (30%) of those who identified as bisexual reported high levels of anxiety, compared to two in 10 (19%) heterosexual or straight people.\n\n####Difference in personal well-being ratings by self-reported sexual identity compared with UK average, 3 years ending December 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc414/worthwhile/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Difference in personal well-being ratings by self-reported sexual identity compared with UK average, 3 years ending December 2015\"/>\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc414/satisfaction/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Life Satisfaction\"/>\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc414/happiness/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Happiness\"/>\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc414/anxiety/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Anxiety\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][1]\n\nNote: Lighter coloured bars, and heterosexual or straight bars are not statistically significant\n\nThose who identify as “other” or “do not know or refuse” also said they had lower life satisfaction, happiness, and worthwhile than the UK average.\n###How big is the LGB community in the UK?\nONS figures^2^ based on the 2015 [Annual Population Survey][2] suggest there are an estimated 920,000 people in the UK who identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, making up 1.7% of the population. London has the highest proportion of LGB-identifying population.\n\nAccording to the same ONS figures, more men say they identify as LGB than women, but more women than men identify as bisexual. Another 2.2 million people say they don’t know, or refuse to answer, while an estimated 206,000 identify as \"other\".\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/Sexual-identity-2015-new.png\"/>][3]\nNote: Numbers do not add up to 100% due to rounding\n###Discrimination may explain some of these differences\nWe don’t actually know why people belonging to the LGB community report lower quality of life. This analysis is an initial step towards highlighting differences but does not take into account a range of factors known to influence well-being when comparing groups. [Research carried out by Stonewall][4] found that one in five LGB employees experienced verbal bullying, and a quarter of them were not open to colleagues about their sexual orientation.\n\nThe National Institute of Economic and Social Research [published a report][5] which found LGB people were more likely to suffer with mental health problems. It outlined potential exposure to discrimination and harassment in relation to all aspects of life, including health service access, education, and employment.\n\nSome 12% of all hate crimes in England and Wales in 2015 to 16 were related to sexual orientation, according to [Home Office figures][6], with 7,194 sexual orientation hate crimes recorded. However, only a quarter of people who are victims of such hate crimes actually report it ([Galop’s 2016 Hate Crime Report PDF][7]), so these incidents are vastly under-reported. [Crime Survey estimates suggest][8] that between 2012 and 2015 there were, on average, 29,000 sexual orientation-related hate crimes each year.\n\n2006: ONS Sexual Identity Project launched\n\n2009: Sexual identity questions first introduced onto the Integrated Household Survey\n\n2011: First experimental statistics published on sexual identity\n\n2017: Personal well-being and sexual identity analysed together for the first time\n\n###What next?\nThere are calls to include questions on sexual identity on the 2021 Census for the first time.

      "markdown": "Social care and the money spent on it is a hot topic, especially now as we have a rapidly ageing population and a [higher life expectancy][1].\n\nAs people get older, not only are they generally more reliant on health services like the NHS for medical treatment; they also require ongoing care. At age 65 a man will spend, on average, 44% of the rest of his life in poorer health, and a woman, 47% of her life.\n\n####Life expectancy at age 65, UK, 2013 to 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc415/stackedbar1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Life expectancy at age 65, UK, 2013 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][2]\n\nSpend on social care in England has decreased in real terms (adjusted for inflation)  since 2009 to 2010, when it was at its highest. The total spend on social care came to [just under £17 billion last financial year][3], according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). This is even lower than spend in 2005 to 2006 (£17.2 billion in real terms).\n\n####Spend on social care, England, 2005 to 2016\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc415/line_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Spend on social care, England, 2005 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][4]\n\nIn Wales, [spend on adult care][5] was £1.4 billion in 2015 to 16 but it has gradually increased over time. In Scotland, the latest figures available, for 2013 to 2014, show spend on adult care was [£2.9 billion][6] annually^1^.\n\nWhile debate has focused on social care funding, much less is known about those people who end up working as carers for their family members. Unpaid adult carers in the UK provide care worth an [estimated £56.9 billion a year][7], in 2014, meaning it could cost this much to replace them with paid carers.\n###Who are the carers?\nDuring the 2015 to 2016 financial year, 8% of the UK's private household population were \"informal carers\" for someone, according to [survey data][8] from the Department for Work and Pensions. Nearly two-thirds (59%) of these carers were females. Half of adult carers were employed either part-time or full-time and nearly a third (29%) said they spent 35 hours or more a week as an informal carer.\n\nThese data refer to caring that is \"not prescriptively defined but includes activities such as going shopping for someone and helping with paperwork\".\n\nWhile ONS doesn’t have data that directly compares to this, we know that counting \"active\" caring - the amount of time spent washing, replacing bandages, etc - looks different. Women over 50 (regardless of whether they were a carer or not), spent on average, 1 minute and 15 seconds actively caring for someone each day. Men of the same age spent just 45 seconds on average each day.\n\nThese figures show that both men and women over 50 [increased the amount][9] they spent on care by 15% and 21% respectively, between 2000 and 2015, which illustrates a growing need for care resources.\n\n####Change in time spent providing adult care by over 50s, UK, between 2000 and 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc415/barhorizontal/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Change in time spentÂ� providing adult care by over 50s, UK, between 2000 and 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][10]\n###How many years do people spend providing unpaid care over their lifetime?\nWe can estimate the average amount of life spent as an unpaid carer using census data and life expectancy data.\n\nWhen women reach 50, they are likely to spend 5.9 years of their remaining life as unpaid carers. At 65, they spend 2.6 years as unpaid carers. In contrast, men at 50 are likely to spend 4.9 years of their remaining life as an unpaid carer and at age 65, it’s 2.7 years.\n\n####Unpaid care likelihood, England, 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc415/isotype/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Unpaid care likelihood, England, 2011\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][11]\n\nCompare this to the likely time spent working, though, and it looks different. In 2010, 50-year-old men were anticipated to work 12.47 years compared with women of the same age, who were anticipated to work 9.8 years. At 65 it is 1.8 years for men and just 1 year for women.\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[Women shoulder the responsibility of unpaid work][12]\n\n[Care home population stabilises as unpaid carer population increases][13]\n\n\n\nIf you like our Visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up][14] to our email alerts, selecting \"stories and infographics\" under preferences.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact us via email at <hhsa@ons.gov.uk>.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/articles/howhaslifeexpectancychangedovertime/2015-09-09\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/lifeexpectancyage65.csv\n  [3]: http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=23352&topics=0%2fSocial+care&sort=Relevance&size=10&page=1#top\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/socialcarespending.csv\n  [5]: https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Local-Government/Finance/Revenue/Social-Services/socialservicesrevenueexpendituresubjectiveanalysis-by-authority\n  [6]: http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2015/03/5885\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/satelliteaccounts/compendium/householdsatelliteaccounts/2005to2014/chapter3homeproducedadultcareservices#gross-value-added-of-informal-adult-care\n  [8]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/600465/family-resources-survey-2015-16.pdf\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/satelliteaccounts/articles/changesinthevalueanddivisionofunpaidcareworkintheuk/2000to2015#changes-in-the-division-of-unpaid-care-between-2000-and-2015-part-2-adult-care\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/timespentchange.csv\n  [11]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/unpaidcareexpectancy.csv\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/womenshouldertheresponsibilityofunpaidwork/2016-11-10\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthcaresystem/articles/carehomepopulationstabilisesasunpaidcarerpopulationincreases/2015-06-08\n  [14]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n\n\n####Footnotes:\n\n1.

      "markdown": "The price of technology has dropped dramatically in the space of 11 years, new analysis has revealed.\n\nONS inflation experts looked at the [change in prices of consumer goods and services][1], from tobacco to hairdressing, dating back to 2005, to help people understand what areas have seen large price rises and falls and how [consumer prices are calculated][2].\n\n\n\nThey found a number of notable changes in prices between 2005 and 2016, such as a 76% drop in the price of laptops, PCs and tablets.\n\nThe price of our goods and services has been headline news of late, as inflation rose to 2.7% in May, and is now at its highest point since April 2012.\n\nIn the quiz below, you can test how much you know about the changing prices of some everyday items.\n\nDrag the circular button across the screen to guess the percentage increase or decrease.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc404/quiz/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"CPIH quiz\"/>\n\n[Download data][3]\n###How have the prices of other everyday items changed?\n####Food\nThere was a notable increase in food prices over the period to 2014. This has been attributed to a mixture of poor weather conditions and high oil prices across the world, which increased the global prices of farmed foods.\n\nThe growth of food prices hit a plateau in the UK in 2014, when discount shops such as Aldi and Lidl gained popularity. A supermarket price war began, with rival retailers slowing price growth to keep customers and remain competitive.\n\n####Liquid fuels\nThe price of liquid fuels, such as oil, increased by 49% in the UK over the period 2007 to 2008. This was due to growing demand driving a worldwide increase in price over the same period. Prices peaked in July 2008, but as the financial downturn hit the global economy, fuel prices plummeted after a matter of months. Between July and December 2008, they had fallen 42%.\n\nPrices began recovering after 2009, peaking in early 2013, in line with improving health in the global economy. Due to a slow-down in demand from developing economies, prices dropped again in 2014, after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) refused to reduce production in order to increase prices.\n\n####Recreation and culture\nThe cost of recreation and sporting services, such as gym membership, leisure centre classes, and golf fees, increased by 53% from 2005.\n\nCultural services, such as satellite TV, music streaming subscriptions and admissions to cultural events, went up by 47% between 2005 and 2016. The highest increase in this category came from newspapers and periodicals, which went up by 65%.\n\nOne of the few areas to see a minimal change in price was in equipment for sport and open-air recreation, such as sleeping bags, fishing rods and gas barbecues. They were less than 1% below the 2005 value.\n###Price changes by category\nThe following charts allow you to look at the changing prices for goods and services by category, indexed from 2005.\n\nThis means a 50% rise in price from 2005 to 2016 would show as a line starting at 100, rising to 150 on the chart. A 50% drop in the same period would see the line drop to 50.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc404/cpih/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"CPIH\"/>\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[How inflation changes how much your wages are worth][4]\n\n[Are your wages keeping up with inflation?][5]\n\n[Hipsters, gin and the Basket of Goods][6]\n\n\n\nIf you like our Visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up][7] to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: <cpi@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/consumerpriceindicesabriefguide/2016\n  [2]: https://blog.ons.gov.uk/2017/03/20/measuring-inflation-whats-changed-and-why/\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/cpih-quiz-data.csv\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/howinflationchangeshowmuchyourwagesareworth/2017-06-26\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/areyourwageskeepingupwithinflation/2017-06-20\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/hipstersginandthebasketofgoods/2017-03-14\n  [7]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n"

But what do ONS population estimates tell us about how this might change the voting population?\n\nIn 2015, the most recent year for which we have constituency-level population estimates, there were 1.5 million 16- and 17-year-olds in the UK. They would have made up 2.87% of the population aged 16 and over.\n###Which areas might have been affected during the 2017 general election?\nOverall there were 88 constituencies^2^ where the number of 16- and 17-year-olds^3^ was greater than the winning margin. This doesn’t mean that the outcome in the seats would have changed, that would depend on voter turnout and preference, but it does show us those areas where there would have been potential for change.\n\nFour of the 10 constituencies with the smallest margins were in Scotland, with the constituencies of North East Fife, Perth and North Perthshire, Glasgow South West and Glasgow East all with a majority of 75 or less.\n\n####Constituencies where the 16- and 17-year-old population was greater than the winning margin, UK, 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc422/wherepercentgreatermargin/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Constituencies where the 16- and 17-year-old population was greater than the winning margin, UK, 2017\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][4]\n\nIn fact there were 19 constituencies in Scotland where the 16- and 17-year-old population is higher than the margin in 59 constituencies (32%). This compares with 22% of constituencies in Northern Ireland, 17.5% in Wales, and 10.5% in England.\n\n####Proportion of seats with 16- and 17-year-old population greater than winning margin, UK, 2017 \n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc422/seatschart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of seats with 16- and 17-year-old population greater than winning margin, UK, 2017\"/>Source: [ONS][5], [NRS][6], [NISRA][7], [House of Commons Library][8]\n\n[Download the data.][9]\n###Which areas would have the greatest share of 16- and 17-year-old voters?\nOf course the areas with the tightest margins will change from election to -election, so another way to look at this is to explore the areas with the largest proportion of 16- and 17-year-olds. The proportion of 16- and 17-year-olds in the population age 16 and over might give us a sense of this population's potential to influence the election outcome.\n\nHowever, care must be taken in using these data to assess the potential impact on election outcomes as these population estimates include some people who are not eligible to vote (for example foreign nationals) and exclude some people who are eligible to vote (for example overseas electors).\n\nBirmingham and Bradford had the largest proportion of 16- and 17-year-olds, as a share of those aged 16 and over. The Birmingham Hodge Hill constituency stood at almost 5% (4.85%), followed by Bradford West (4.38%), Bradford East (4.21%) and Birmingham, Hall Green.\n\n####Proportion of 16- and 17-year-olds in population aged 16 and over, UK, 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc422/votingpercent/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of 16- and 17-year-olds in population aged 16 and over, UK, 2015\"/>Source: [ONS][10], [NRS][11], [NISRA][12]\n\n[Download the data.][13]\n\nThe smallest proportions of 16- and 17-year-olds were found in Battersea (1.48%), Glasgow North (1.54%) and Glasgow Central (1.58%).\n\n\n####Timeline of UK electoral change\n\nThe Great Reform Act of 1832 introduced voter registration, broadened those who could vote (although the working class largely remained ineligible to vote), and created new seats in England and Wales.\n\nPrior to the Great Reform Act, voting was limited by the fact that two-thirds of MPs stood for election in uncontested seats, meaning for much of the country, voting was not even possible.\n\nIn 1867 another Great Reform Act extended the vote to all householders, which gave the vote to many working class men who had previously been excluded from voting. It was not until the 20th century that significant changes were made to electoral law that dramatically changed the number of people who were eligible to vote.\n\nBy 1908, the vote was limited to men over 21 who “paid rates” or owned property. This is estimated at about 60% of the adult male population.\n\nThe Representation of the People Act 1918 extended the vote so there was no longer a property qualification for men. More famously, perhaps, it extended the vote to women at parliamentary elections, though this was limited to those over 30, and the property qualification still applied to them.\n\nThe 1918 Act added 13.7m women and 5.3m men to the electorate. Had women been given the vote on equal terms with men, as they eventually were in 1928, they would have been in the majority, due to loss of men during the war.\n\nFull electoral equality was not achieved until 1928, and the franchise as we know it today did not emerge until 1969, when the voting age was reduced from 21 to 18.\n\nIn 2015 a bill allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in the Scottish and local government elections has been passed unanimously at Holyrood.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[How inflation changes how much your wages are worth][14]\n\n[What's changed since the Brexit vote?][15]\n\n[What's affects an area's life expectancy?][16]\n\n\n\nIf you like our Visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up][17] to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: <better.info@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n  [1]: #timeline\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/votechart.csv\n  [3]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39921090/will-the-voting-age-ever-be-lowered-to-16\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/marginmap.csv\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/parliamentaryconstituencymidyearpopulationestimates\n  [6]: https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/population-estimates/2011-based-special-area-population-estimates/spc-population-estimates\n  [7]: https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/2015-mid-year-population-estimates-northern-ireland\n  [8]: http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7979\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/seatschart.csv\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/parliamentaryconstituencymidyearpopulationestimates\n  [11]: https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/population-estimates/2011-based-special-area-population-estimates/spc-population-estimates\n  [12]: https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/2015-mid-year-population-estimates-northern-ireland\n  [13]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/16votemap.csv\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/howinflationchangeshowmuchyourwagesareworth/2017-06-26\n  [15]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/articles/whatschangedsincethebrexitvote/2017-06-23\n  [16]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/hipstersginandthebasketofgoods/2017-03-14\n  [17]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n\n\n\n####Footnotes:\n\n1.

      "markdown": "As Brexit negotiations progress, the staff and leaders of British industry will be keeping a keen eye on developments.\n\nThe EU is the UK’s biggest single trading partner: it [accounted][1] for 48% of goods exports from the UK and 39% of services exports in 2016.\n\nAnd some industries will have a particular focus on negotiations – given the value of their exports to the EU – such as British carmakers and finance companies.\n\nThe EU also helps fund scientific research and development, its regulations govern areas like British agriculture and there are more than two million EU nationals working in the UK, their employers ranging from hotels and restaurants to public services.\n\nWhile the outcomes of Brexit – whether positive, neutral or negative for different businesses – will not be known for some time, [analysis from the ONS][2] shows where various industries are concentrated.\n\nThis gives a clearer insight into parts of the country that may have a particular interest in the Brexit debate, because they are home to a concentration of industry or industries which have most at stake when the terms surrounding access to the single market, the free movement of labour, levels of funding and existing EU regulations are discussed.\n\n####Find out which industries are most and least concentrated in your area.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc421/charts/all/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Find out which industries are most and least concentrated in your area.\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][3]\n\n###Which areas benefit most from trade links with the EU?\n\nBritish businesses enjoy free trade with the EU at the moment, but a failure to reach a trade agreement could mean facing tariffs and quotas under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.\n\nThe auto sector is particularly reliant on [trade with the EU][4] for both export sales and imports of key components in the production process. The EU [accounted][5] for 42% of UK car exports and 88% of imports in 2016. If the UK and EU were to trade under WTO rules, cars would face a 10% tariff. Around one-third of jobs in the car industry are in the West Midlands. This was equivalent to more than 50,000 jobs in 2015.\n\nTrade with EU countries is equally crucial for UK finance companies. The UK is a net exporter of financial services, and the EU is a significant consumer. Around £24 billion of [financial services exports][6], 45% of the total, went to the EU in 2015.\n\n####Concentration of industry, 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc421/map/maps/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Concentration of industry, 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n\nLondon is at the forefront of the UK’s service-based economy. More than one in three financial services roles are in the capital, against just 2% of manufacturing jobs.\n\nHowever, its status as a[ financial centre][8] could be under threat depending on the Brexit outcome. Several major banks are considering [moving jobs elsewhere][9] amid fears over future trade arrangements.\n\nBig companies moving away from London could have an impact on the rest of Britain. [Recent ONS figures][10] indicated that London is the largest net contributor to UK public finances. \n\nThere remains a clear industry imbalance between London and the major northern cities. This is partly behind the government’s [Northern Powerhouse][11] initiative, which aims to create more skilled jobs and boost economic growth in the North. In 2015, jobs in skilled service industries such as IT, finance and science were all far more concentrated in London than in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Leeds and Sheffield.\n\nWhereas Londoners voted strongly in favour of maintaining the status quo and remaining in the EU last June, the majority of voters in the north of England chose to leave.\n\n####Concentration of industry, 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc421/charts/london/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Concentration of industry, 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][12]\n\n###Where in Britain are the sectors most associated with migrant workers?\n\nThe future of EU nationals living and working in the UK will be discussed during Article 50 negotiations. EU migrant workers are important to many sectors including hotels and restaurants, construction and public services.\n\nEmployment in hotels and restaurants is concentrated in coastal areas of Britain. West Somerset, Weymouth and Portland and the Isle of Scilly have higher than average proportions of jobs in the sector. Such local economies could face staff shortages if EU nationals were to leave en masse. More than 210,000 EU nationals were employed in UK hotels and restaurants in 2015, equivalent to 13% of the sector’s workforce.\n\n####Concentration of industry, 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc421/map/maps/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Concentration of industry, 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][13]\n\nAny changes to EU workers’ rights may also have an impact on [construction projects][14] across Britain. South Ribble, near Preston in Lancashire, had the highest concentration of construction jobs (more than four times the national average). Further south, Epping Forest, between Greater London and Essex, had nearly three times as many construction workers than the British average. Overall, there were more than 150,000 EU nationals working in construction across the UK in 2015.\n\nFinally, there were more than 300,000 EU nationals working in education, health and social care in 2015. Education professionals were highly concentrated in university towns such as Oxford and Cambridge.\n\n###Where are the sectors affected by EU funding and regulation?\n\nScientific research across Great Britain benefits from[ EU funding][15] and many EU researchers are employed by British firms and universities. Scientific research and development is crucial for discovering new medical techniques, promoting innovation and improving productivity in the economy. Brexit negotiations could have a major bearing on the sector’s future.\n\nThe East of England and the South East are hotspots for scientific research and development. Together, they accounted for more than half of employment in the sector in 2015.\n\nAgriculture and fishing are arguably most affected by EU regulation. The EU’s[ Common Agricultural Policy][16] and[ Common Fisheries Policy][17] have governed their respective industries for decades. Both sectors could therefore see changes post-Brexit.\n\nWales and Scotland have the highest concentration of jobs in agriculture, forestry and fishing. More than half of British employment in fishing and aquaculture is in Scotland, with the share in the Highlands and Islands more than 50 times its share of total employment.\n\n####Concentration of industry, 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc421/map/maps/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Concentration of industry, 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][18]\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n[What's changed in the year since the Brexit vote?][20]\n[Trading places: UK goods trade with EU partners][21]\n[Five facts about... the UK service sector][22]\n\nIf you like our visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up ][23]to our email alerts, selecting ‘stories and infographics’ under 'preferences.'\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/datasets/publicationtablesuktrade\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/thespatialdistributionofindustriesingreatbritain/2015\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/industryconcentration_localauthority.csv\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/adhocs/007219tradeingoodscommoditysplitbyeuandnoneucountries\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/adhocs/007219tradeingoodscommoditysplitbyeuandnoneucountries\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/adhocs/006656balanceofpaymentsannualgeographicaldatatables\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/industryconcentration_NUTS2.csv\n  [8]: http://www.cityam.com/261819/london-holds-off-new-york-keep-its-top-spot-worlds-number\n  [9]: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-banks-idUSKBN18413K\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/articles/countryandregionalpublicsectorfinances/2015to2016\n  [11]: http://northernpowerhouse.gov.uk/\n  [12]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/LondonvsNorth-1.csv\n  [13]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/industryconcentration_NUTS2.csv\n  [14]: http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economics-rics-idUKKBN16M003\n  [15]: https://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/news/uk-based-researchers-are-top-recipients-latest-round-eu-funding_en\n  [16]: https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-overview_en\n  [17]: https://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp_en\n  [18]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/industryconcentration_NUTS2.csv\n  [19]: mailto:better.info@ons.gov.uk\n  [20]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/articles/whatschangedsincethebrexitvote/2017-06-23\n  [21]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/internationaltrade/articles/tradingplacesukgoodstradewitheupartners/2017-03-28\n  [22]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/articles/fivefactsabouttheukservicesector/2016-09-29\n  [23]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n"

      "markdown": "Older people in England and Wales are getting married and divorced in greater numbers. What's behind it? Why are these so-called \"[silver splicers][1]\" and \"[silver separators][2]\" starting and ending relationships in later life?\n\n###Marriages of opposite-sex couples\n\nThe number of brides and grooms aged 65 and over went up by 46% in a decade, from 7,468 in 2004 to 10,937 in 2014, the most recent ONS marriage data has shown.\n\nBut this is against the backdrop of an ageing population, with the number of people aged 65 and over up by 20% in the same period. This is due to the post-war baby boom as well as people living longer.\n\nWhen we looked at marriage rates for those aged 65 and over – the number of people getting married as a proportion of the single, divorced or widowed population – there was still an increase for both sexes since 2009.\n\n####Marriage rates for people aged 65 and over (opposite-sex couples), by sex, England and Wales, 2004 to 2014\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc420/chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Marriage rates for people aged 65 and over (opposite-sex couples), by sex, England and Wales, 2004 to 2014\"/>[Download the data.][3]\n\nWhy are the proportions so different between men and women? Simply, men tend to marry younger women. More than half (56%) of men aged 65 and over who tied the knot in 2014 married a woman under 65; in contrast, only 22% of women aged 65 and over married a man under 65.\n\nAlmost all (92%) of the brides and grooms aged 65 and over in 2014 were divorcees, widows or widowers, with only 8% getting married for the first time.\n###Marriages and civil partnerships of same-sex couples\nThe first marriages of same-sex couples [took place on 29 March 2014][4], so we don’t yet have a complete year of data. But the part-year up to the end of 2014 shows that 2.4% of men and 0.8% of women marrying partners of the same sex were aged 65 and over.\n\nAs expected, when marriage was introduced for same-sex couples, the number of civil partnership formations fell steeply, from 5,646 in 2013 to only 861 in 2015. Older people have made up a greater proportion of civil partnerships since 2013.\n\n####Percentage of people forming civil partnerships who were aged 65 and over, by sex, England and Wales, 2005 to 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc420/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of people forming civil partnerships who were aged 65 and over, by sex, England and Wales, 2005 to 2015\"/>[Download the data.][5]\n###Divorces among opposite-sex couples\nIn England and Wales, divorce is in decline – our most recent 10 years of data show a 28% fall in the number of divorces between 2005 and 2015.\n\nBut older people are bucking the trend. In the same period, the number of men divorcing aged 65 and over went up by 23% and the number of women of the same age divorcing increased by 38%.\n\nTo take account of the large rise in the number of people in this age group in the same period – and the larger number of them who are married – we can look at the number of men and women divorcing as a proportion of the married population. This shows that the divorce rate has actually remained broadly consistent over the past decade.\n\n####Divorce rates for opposite-sex couples aged 65 and over, by sex, England and Wales, 2005 to 2015^1^\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc420/chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Divorce rates for opposite-sex couples aged 65 and over, by sex, England and Wales, 2005 to 2015^1^\"/>[Download the data.][6]\n###Divorce and dissolutions among same-sex couples\nThe first divorces recorded between same-sex couples were in 2015, when a total of 22 couples in all age groups divorced.\n\nDissolutions of civil partnership were first granted in 2007. Between 2007 and 2015, only 131 men and women aged 65 and over dissolved a civil partnership in England and Wales. This represents 1.1%  of all dissolutions. However this analysis is limited because of the small number of dissolutions that have actually taken place.\n###Why is it happening?\nThe increase in older people ending and forming new relationships is likely to be because they are living longer.\n\nIn 2004, an average 65-year-old man could expect to live for a further 17 years and a woman for a further 20 years. Continuing a long-term trend, in 2017, this has increased to 19 years for a man and almost 22 years for a woman. The gap between male and female life expectancy is also narrowing.\n\n####Period life expectancy at age 65, by sex, England and Wales, 2004 to 2017^2^\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc420/chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Period life expectancy at age 65, by sex, England and Wales, 2004 to 2017^2^\"/>[Download the data.][7]\n\nWe also know that older people are more connected, economically and socially, than they were before. People aged 65 and over are [more likely than ever to be working][8], and therefore be able to support themselves outside marriage. They’re also [catching up with younger people in their use of the internet][9] – perhaps trying out online dating?\n\nWe can’t rule out practical reasons for older couples deciding to tie the knot. One of these may be a [substantial change to inheritance tax rules made in October 2007][10], which allowed married couples or those in civil partnerships to transfer their tax-free allowances between each other for the first time.\n###What does this mean for our society?\nIn the future, people in England aged 65 and over are more likely to be living with just their partner than on their own, according to projections by the Department for Communities and Local Government.  This may be because of the large number of post-war “baby boomers” living longer, combined with the closing of the gap between male and female life expectancy, meaning fewer widows and widowers living on their own. Older people forming relationships later in life may also be a factor.\n\n####Households with a household representative^3^ aged 65 and over, England, 1991 to 2039\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc420/chart5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Households with a household representative^3^ aged 65 and over, England, 1991 to 2039\"/>[Download the data.][11]\n\nIt is possible that older people marrying and divorcing in greater numbers will have an effect on how happy we are: those who are married, remarried or in a civil partnership are [least likely to say that they feel lonely][12]. People living with a partner may find themselves spending some of their later years providing [unpaid social care][13] for their loved one.\n\n\n\n####Other Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[Unpaid care worth £57 billion][14]\n[Lesbian, gay, and bisexual people say they experience a lower quality of life][15]\n[What affects an area’s healthy life expectancy?][16]\n\n\n\nIf you like our Visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up][17] to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/silver-splicers-make-sixty-the-new-sexy-lh87snwhtxp\n  [2]: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/nov/24/silver-separators-over-50s-divorce-splitting-up-children\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/chart1.csv\n  [4]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26793127\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/chart2.csv\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/chart3.csv\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/chart4.csv\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/fivefactsaboutolderpeopleatwork/2016-10-01\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/itandinternetindustry/bulletins/internetusers/2017#recent-internet-use-for-those-aged-65-and-over-is-catching-up-with-younger-age-groups\n  [10]: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/tax/2817621/How-couples-will-gain-600000-allowance-on-inheritance-tax.html\n  [11]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/chart5.csv\n  [12]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105231923/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/older-people-and-loneliness/index.html\n  [13]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/?p=12403\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/articles/unpaidcarersprovidesocialcareworth57billion/2017-07-10\n  [15]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/sexuality/articles/lesbiangayandbisexualpeoplesaytheyexperiencealowerqualityoflife/2017-07-05\n  [16]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/articles/whataffectsanareashealthylifeexpectancy/2017-06-28\n  [17]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n  [18]: mailto:digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

UK nationals make up the rest,  91 out of every 100 people in the population.\n\nWhen it comes to employment, nationals from EU8 and EU2 countries are the most likely of any nationality in the UK to be in work (83% of the migrant population from those groups).\n\nNon-EU nationals had the lowest proportion of people in employment (62%), reflecting the fact that many non-EU nationals are here to study. At slightly more than 1 in 10, 11% of non-EU nationals were estimated to be inactive and state study as the reason for inactivity, the highest proportion compared with other nationalities.\n\nApproximately three-quarters of nationals from the UK and EU14 countries were in employment (74% and 76% respectively). \n\n###Explore key migrant employment facts \nWhile there is no such thing as an “average” working person, we’ve pulled out the dominant employment characteristics within each nationality group - EU14, EU8, EU2, non-EU, UK.\n\n####A worker from the EU14 is most likely to…\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc405/migrationprofiles/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Key migrant employment facts\"/>\n\n###Future migrant labour from the EU\nIt’s clear that some industries and occupations are more reliant on migrant labour than others, and the relationship between workers, wages, skills, occupations and nationality is under scrutiny, particularly for workers from EU countries outside the UK as Brexit negotiations start.\n\nThat includes the manufacturing industry, which takes 11% of its workforce from the EU, as well as the  transport, construction and the distribution, hotels and restaurant industries, which each take 9% of their workforce from the EU respectively.^5^\n\nThese figures don’t include additional short-term workers, such as seasonal workers, and so the importance of EU labour in these areas may be greater still.\n\nIt’s worth noting that nationals from the EU8 and EU2 countries tend to work longer hours for less money (based on median gross hourly pay), and, in common with EU14 nationals, are more likely to be over-qualified for the roles they are doing than UK nationals, yet they are more likely to be in jobs requiring low skills. \n\nNationals from EU14 countries tend to be in jobs requiring high skills, and earn more than UK nationals.\n\nThe future relationship between the UK and workers from the EU may not be known for some time, but many employers and employees will be following discussions very closely.\n\n###Notes and definitions:\n\n###Hourly pay\n\nWhen comparing the average gross hourly pay (the amount of pay received per hour before tax, National Insurance and other deductions) by nationality, the median is chosen as the main measure; that is the data value at which 50% of data values are above it and 50% of data values are below it. \n\nWe present the median because the distribution of earnings is not symmetrical, with more people earning lower salaries than higher salaries; this is consistent with other ONS publications, such as the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), ONS’ preferred measure of earnings.\n\n\n\nMore information on migration estimates for the UK is available [here][6].

Defined as non-UK nationals\n\n2. EU14 are countries who were members of the EU prior to 2004: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. EU8 are countries who joined the EU January 2004: Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia. EU2 is Bulgaria and Romania, who joined the EU in January 2007.\n\n\tNon-EU is all other countries outside of the UK, with the exception of Cyprus, Malta and Croatia, which are known as EU Other, but are not included in this analysis as there are not enough available data to make comparisons.\n\n3. More likely means a higher percentage of people in one nationality group compared with the percentage of people in the comparison nationality group, while less likely means a lower percentage.\n\n4. The analysis is largely based on calendar year data from the Annual Population Survey (APS) for 2016 (the latest calendar year available at the time of writing).\n\n\tIn the APS, a person’s nationality is self-reported and is therefore influenced by how a person perceives their nationality.\n\n\tThe APS is designed to measure resident population stocks within the UK (the number of people living in the UK on a permanent basis). It was not designed to measure population flows (the number of people entering and leaving the UK) and should not be used as such.\n\n\tThe APS collects data from individuals in households, but does not include most communal establishments (managed accommodation such as halls of residence, hostels and care homes). This means that students resident in communal establishments will only be included in APS estimates if their parents (resident in a household) are sampled and include the absent student. The APS will include long-term migrants and some short-term migrants. It is unlikely to sample short-term migrants living in the UK for very short periods of time.\n\n\tThis could have a disproportionate effect on certain categories of overseas nationals than others. For example, students and short-term or seasonal workers from overseas (such as those working in the agricultural industry) may be more likely to stay in communal establishments or be in the UK on a short-term basis and will therefore be excluded from the sample resulting in their under-representation.\n\n\tThe analysis also draws from data available in the APS 3-year pooled dataset Jan 2013 to Dec 2015 (the most recent available); this dataset provides a larger sample on which to conduct analysis, which allows more detailed analysis to be undertaken. But, as this dataset encompasses three years it is less sensitive to more volatile trends than one year datasets.\n\n5. All data taken from APS 2016.\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40354331\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/04/EU14-data-download.xls\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/EU2-data-download.xls\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/04/EU8-data-download.xls\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/OUTSIDE-EU-data-download.csv\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration\n  [7]: mailto:migstatsunit@ons.gov.uk\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/internationaltrade/articles/commonwealthtradeinfocusasukpreparesforbrexit/2017-03-09\n  [9]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-trade-partners/\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/articles/dashboardunderstandingtheukeconomy/2017-02-22\n  [11]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n\n\n"

      "markdown": "<ons-box align=\"full\">\n####Correction:\n1pm, 21 January 2019. A small error occurred in the annotation for the first chart, entitled 'Number of price quotes with recorded increase or reduction in package size, January 2012 to June 2017'. The annotation referred to the number of products that had decreased in size, whereas the chart actually reflects the number of price quotes that decreased in size. We have corrected this error in this release. We apologise for any inconvenience.\n</ons-box>\n\nNo, you’re not imagining it – some of your favourite sweets really are shrinking. In November 2016, Toblerone chocolate bars [reduced in size][1] by about 10%, provoking [outrage online][2]. And [Maltesers, M&Ms and Minstrels][3] have gone the same way.\n\nIt’s a phenomenon known as \"shrinkflation\" – where manufacturers reduce the package size of household goods while keeping the price the same.\n\nBut it’s not just chocolate bars. Over the last few years, journalists have found examples of [loo roll, coffee, fruit juice][4], [sausages, beer and chips][5] getting smaller without getting any cheaper.\n\nAt ONS we keep a close eye on prices, sending hundreds of data collectors into shops every month to record the prices of specific products (known as the [\"basket of goods\"][6]) to help us calculate the rate of inflation. As part of this process, we look out for pack sizes changing so that we can make sure we’re comparing like with like.\n\nWhen we looked at the data from the last 5 years, we found that lots of the items we recorded had reduced in size or weight – mostly in the \"food and drink\" category.\n\n####Number of price quotes with recorded increase or reduction in package size, January 2012 to June 2017\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc423/chart1/chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Number of price quotes with recorded increase or reduction in package size, January 2012 to June 2017\"/>\n\nShrinking food and drink pack sizes isn’t new – we’ve seen it for at least the last 5 years.\n\n####Number of food price quotes with recorded reduction in package size, January 2012 to June 2017^1^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc423/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Number of food price quotes with recorded reduction in package size, January 2012 to June 2017^1^\"/>\n\n###Shrinkflation and inflation\n\nDo these shrinking pack sizes contribute to inflation? After all, if you’re paying the same amount of money to receive less, your money is not worth as much as it used to be.\n\nWhen working out our published inflation rates, we always adjust our prices data to take account of changing pack sizes. To look at the impact of shrinkflation, we recalculate the original price as if the pack size had always been the new size and calculate the rate again. If the two figures are different, we know that shrinkflation is contributing to inflation. (For technical details of how we do this, read our [methodology paper][7].)\n\nWhen we looked at the lead measure of inflation in our publications, known as [CPIH][8], there was no discernible effect. That wasn’t very surprising – CPIH includes a huge sample of prices of goods and services from across the economy, including energy prices, housing costs, transport, health and education and much more. Food and drink is a relatively small proportion of this measure.\n\nBut even within the \"food and non-alcoholic beverages\" category, shrinkflation had no noticeable effect. This could be because the number of shrinking pack sizes is relatively small.\n\nHowever, in one small subcategory, we found that the changing pack size had contributed 1.22 percentage points to the rate of inflation of those items since the beginning of 2012. That was the sweetest one: \"sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery\".\n\n####\"Sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery\" index, published and non-adjusted, January 2012 to June 2017\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc423/chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"\"\"Sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery\"\" index, published and non-adjusted\"/>\n\n###Why are prices rising?\nMost chocolate manufacturers have blamed the need to resize their products on rising raw material costs. In October 2016, [Toblerone said][9]: “We are experiencing higher costs for numerous ingredients… we had to make a decision between changing the shape of the bar, and raising the price.”\n\nMars, who make Maltesers, M&Ms and Minstrels, [told The Independent][10]: “We have been absorbing rising raw material and operational costs for some time, but the growing pressures mean that we can’t keep things as they are.”\n\nSugar and cocoa are two of the most important ingredients in confectionery and their price has fluctuated considerably in recent years. The European import price of sugar has been slowly falling since the middle of 2014 and in March 2017 it reached its lowest level since the International Monetary Fund records began in 1991.\n\n####Sugar: European import price, 2012 to June 2017\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc423/chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Sugar: European import price, 2012 to June 2017\"/>\n\nThe price of cocoa reached a [5-year high in December 2015][11] (because of droughts in the three biggest cocoa-exporting countries) but has fallen sharply over the last year.\n\n####Cocoa beans: International Cocoa Organization cash price, US and European ports, 2012 to June 2017\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc423/chart5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Cocoa beans: International Cocoa Organization cash price, US and European ports, 2012 to June 2017\"/>\n\nManufacturers’ costs may also be rising because of the recent [fall in the value of the pound][12] – leading [some commentators][13] to attribute shrinkflation to the UK’s decision to leave the European Union. But our analysis doesn’t show a noticeable change following the referendum that would point towards a Brexit effect. Furthermore, others (including [Which?][14]) had been observing these shrinking pack sizes long before the EU referendum, and several manufacturers have denied that this is a major factor.\n\n\n\n###Other Visual.ONS articles:\n[The changing price of everyday goods and services][15]\n[Hipsters, gin and the Basket of Goods\n][16][How inflation changes how much your wages are worth][17]\n\n\n\nIf you like our Visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up][18] to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: <digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/08/toblerone-faces-mountain-of-criticism-over-stupid-change-to-its/\n  [2]: http://www.cityam.com/253156/everyones-weighing-toblerone-tragedy-their-outrage-and\n  [3]: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/malteser-m-ms-minstrels-packs-smaller-shrinkflation-15-per-cent-reduction-size-a7651576.html\n  [4]: http://www.which.co.uk/news/2016/04/discover-the-latest-supermarket-products-that-have-shrunk-439230/\n  [5]: http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/on-demand/64584-005\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/whatsinthebasketofgoods70yearsofshoppinghistory/2016-07-21\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/theimpactofshrinkflationoncpihuk/january2012tojune2017\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/june2017\n  [9]: https://www.facebook.com/Toblerone/posts/1308853319149448\n  [10]: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/malteser-m-ms-minstrels-packs-smaller-shrinkflation-15-per-cent-reduction-size-a7651576.html\n  [11]: https://www.icco.org/about-us/international-cocoa-agreements/doc_download/1732-icco-monthly-review-july-2015.html\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/whyhasthevalueofthepoundbeenfallingandwhatcouldthismeanforpeopleintheuk/2016-10-28\n  [13]: http://uk.businessinsider.com/shrinkflation-brexit-food-prices-pound-2017-4\n  [14]: http://www.which.co.uk/news/2016/04/discover-the-latest-supermarket-products-that-have-shrunk-439230/\n  [15]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/thechangingpriceofeverydaygoodsandservices/2017-07-11\n  [16]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/hipstersginandthebasketofgoods/2017-03-14\n  [17]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/howinflationchangeshowmuchyourwagesareworth/2017-06-26\n  [18]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n  [19]: mailto:digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1. This chart shows the number of food item price quotes that saw a reduction in package size in each month. Many price quotes are collected for the same item, for example “Carton/Box of Chocolates”. Price collectors aim to select products which are popular, and so it is possible that several price collectors will price the same product (a particular brand of chocolates, for example). Such an item may experience a change in size, and this may explain the big spike in package size reductions in April 2014, where there were 87 instances of the same item changing size."

      "markdown": "In the last 20 years, UK tourists have turned their backs on traditional 2-week holidays in favour of short breaks and week-long trips. And one-day \"booze cruises\" across the Channel to stock up on alcohol and cigarettes are much less common than they used to be.\n\nGoing abroad on holiday in the 1990s was very different. [Hardly anyone had access to the internet][1], so you probably booked your trip by going to a travel agent or finding a cheap package deal on [Teletext][2]. Once you arrived at your destination, clutching your guide book, film camera and travellers cheques, you were pretty incommunicado, unless you found a phone box or an internet cafe.\n\nWe looked at data from our International Passenger Survey in 1996 and 2016 to uncover the biggest differences in our holiday habits between the 1990s and now.\n\n###We’re going on more holidays…\n\nIn 2016, UK residents went on more than 45 million foreign holidays, up from 27 million in 1996. That’s a 68% rise in the number of holidays, while the UK population increased by 12% in the same period.\n\n####Total number of holidays overseas by UK residents, 1996 to 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc424/Chart-1/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Total number of holidays overseas by UK residents, 1996 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3]\n\n###…but they’re shorter than they used to be\n\nOne of the biggest changes we’ve seen over the last 20 years is the marked decline in the popularity of 2-week holidays and the rise of short breaks.\n\nThe week-long break is a lot more popular than before, and there’s also been an increase in the number of holidays lasting 10 nights.\n\nUK residents are making far fewer day-trips abroad than they did 20 years ago. This could be because many of these visits were “booze cruises” – journeys across the English Channel to stock up on alcohol and cigarettes – which are no longer as cost-efficient as they used to be. [Duty-free sales within the EU ended in 1999][4], [France has been ratcheting up the price of cigarettes][5] since 2000, and in recent years the [pound has fallen in value][6] against the euro.\n\n####Duration of holidays overseas by UK residents, 1996 and 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc424/Chart-2/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Duration of holidays overseas by UK residents, 1996 and 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][7]\n\n###No-frills airlines have taken off\n\nOne of the most likely explanations for UK residents going on more, shorter, holidays is the growth of the budget airlines.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, the European Council [relaxed the rules to create a common aviation area across Europe][8], allowing low-cost carriers including EasyJet and Ryanair to enter the market.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2015 ([the most recent figures available][9] from the Civil Aviation Authority), passenger numbers at UK airports increased by 85%, from 135 million to 251 million – continuing a long-term trend. And [according to the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation in 2003][10], “around 50% of the traffic on low-cost carriers is newly generated” – which means half of the people flying on budget airlines in Europe weren’t making those journeys before.\n\n###Top 10 destinations for UK holidaymakers\n\nComparing the most popular holiday destinations in 1996 and 2016, not a lot has changed at the top of the chart: we still love visiting Spain and France.\n\nHowever, while the number of holidays to Spain has rocketed (up 87% in 20 years), France is one of the few countries we’re visiting less than we were in 1996: the number of holidays by UK residents has fallen by 9%.\n\nBudget airlines may be behind this too: rather than driving to France on a ferry (the number of holidaymakers travelling by sea has declined by 33% since 1996), tourists are perhaps opting for a cheap flight elsewhere instead.\n\nGermany has now joined the top 10 destinations for UK holidaymakers, and another new entry is cruising – which is now four times as popular as it was 20 years ago. This could be due to an ageing population, with increasing numbers of older people in the population – but cruise operators are also [trying to extend their appeal to younger holidaymakers][11] too.\n\nTwo destinations that have dropped out of the top 10 since 1996 are Belgium and Turkey.\n\n####Top 10 destinations for UK resident holidaymakers, 2016 (with 1996 figures)\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc424/Chart-3/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"TopÂ� 10 destinations for UK resident holidaymakers, 2016 (with 1996 figures)\"/>\n\n[Download the data][12]\n\n###Outside the top 10\nFurther down the rankings, we can look at some countries that have become a lot more popular with UK resident holidaymakers since 1996.\n\nNumber of holidays by UK residents, selected countries, 1996 and 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc424/Chart-4/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Cluster HORIZONTAL\"/>\n\n[Download the data][13]\n\nThe United Arab Emirates’ (UAE’s) popularity with British holidaymakers is especially striking. It’s largely due to the popularity of Dubai, where the UAE has invested heavily in hotels and shopping malls, and has been [rewarded with ever-greater numbers of British tourists][14].\n\nPoland and Romania have joined the EU in the intervening years (in 2004 and 2007 respectively), and Romanian nationals gained full rights to work in the UK in 2014. This made travel between the countries much simpler. In 2016 many of the UK resident holidaymakers were nationals of the countries they visited (69% of those visiting Romania for holidays were Romanian and 31% of those going to Poland were Polish), perhaps returning to spend the holidays with family and friends.\n\nCroatia joined the EU in 2013, and the dramatic rise in visitor numbers partially reflects the emergence of the country from the Balkans War, which only ended in late 1995.\n\nIceland’s newfound popularity is less straightforward to explain – the rise in the numbers of UK holidaymakers began around 2010, just 2 years after the economic crisis [devalued the Icelandic krona][15], making the country much more affordable for foreign tourists.\n\n2010 was also the year that the volcano Eyjafjallajokull erupted, sending clouds of ash into the skies above Europe and grounding planes across the world, and [some think][16] that the TV pictures of Iceland shown around the globe encouraged visitors to go there. “Secret to Iceland’s Tourism Boom? A Financial Crash and a Volcanic Eruption” read the headline [in the New York Times][17].\n\nOnly five countries with significant visitor numbers suffered a decline in the numbers of holidaymakers. Besides France (see \"Top 10 destinations for UK holidaymakers\" section), the countries that saw the biggest falls were those that have experienced terrorist incidents and security concerns in recent years: Turkey, Egypt, Kenya and Tunisia.\n\n####Number of holidays by UK residents, selected countries, 1996 and 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc424/Chart-5/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Number of holidays by UK residents, selected countries, 1996 and 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][18]\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/bulletins/internetaccesshouseholdsandindividuals/2017#household-internet-access-continues-to-rise\n  [2]: http://teletext.mb21.co.uk/gallery/TeletextLtd/\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/08/chart1data.csv\n  [4]: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/381753.stm\n  [5]: http://www.lefigaro.fr/economie/le-scan-eco/2017/06/23/29001-20170623ARTFIG00135-prix-du-tabac-la-ministre-de-la-sante-veut-une-augmentation-forte-et-rapide.php\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/whyhasthevalueofthepoundbeenfallingandwhatcouldthismeanforpeopleintheuk/2016-10-28\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/08/chart2data.csv\n  [8]: http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00182/SN00182.pdf\n  [9]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/546891/avi0101.ods\n  [10]: https://www.icao.int/sustainability/CaseStudies/StatesReplies/Europe_LowCost_En.pdf\n  [11]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-40030147\n  [12]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/08/chart3data.csv\n  [13]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/08/chart4data.csv\n  [14]: http://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/uk-visitors-to-dubai-to-cross-1-million-mark-2015-07-10-1.596404\n  [15]: https://www.ft.com/content/3afe4c14-9385-11dd-9a63-0000779fd18c\n  [16]: https://www.ft.com/content/44ebbfee-025e-11e7-aa5b-6bb07f5c8e12\n  [17]: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/17/world/europe/reykjavik-iceland-tourism.html\n  [18]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/08/chart5data.csv\n  [19]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/migrationtheeuropeanunionandworkhowmuchdoyoureallyknow/2017-07-19\n  [20]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/articles/whatschangedsincethebrexitvote/2017-06-23\n  [21]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/whyhasthevalueofthepoundbeenfallingandwhatcouldthismeanforpeopleintheuk/2016-10-28\n  [22]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n  [23]: mailto:digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk\n"

Emissions from vehicles contribute to pollution and climate change, as well as harming our health. As the UK’s plan for this notes: \"Although air pollution has improved, it still poses an urgent health problem\".\n###Nearly all of the cars on our roads are diesel or petrol\nThere were 30.8 million licensed cars on the roads in Great Britain in 2016. This has risen by nearly 10 million since 1994.\n\n\nIn 2016, diesel cars accounted for 39.1% of licensed cars on our roads, up from just 7.4% in 1994. Meanwhile, petrol cars accounted for 59.7% of all licensed cars in 2016, down from 92.6% in 1994. \n\nThe rise in the sale of diesel cars in recent years is linked to a tax cut on diesel cars and a reduced vehicle tax on all cars with low carbon dioxide emissions, which encouraged people to trade their petrol cars for diesel vehicles.\n\nThere has been an increase in the number of alternative fuel vehicles, which includes electric cars, illustrating some willingness for consumers to adapt to new technologies. However, they still make up a tiny percentage (1.2%) of all licensed cars on the road today.\n\n####Number of vehicles licensed^1^, Great Britain, 1994 to 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc426/petroldiesel/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Number of vehicles licensed^1^, Great Britain, 1994 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][2]\n###Motorists pay the bulk of environmental taxes\nEnvironmental tax accounts for 7.2% of all taxes and social contributions to government. It includes transport, energy, pollution and resource taxes.\n\nGovernment revenue from environmental taxes reached £47.6 billion in 2016. Revenue from the taxes that affect motorists – indirect taxes like the tax on fuel, and direct taxes like vehicle tax – make up a high proportion of the overall revenue from environmental taxes.\n\n####Government revenue from environmental taxes^2^, UK, 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc426/tax2016/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Government revenue from environmental taxes^2^, UK, 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][3]\n###Few people are thinking about buying an electric car\nJust 5% of adults aged 16 and over had thought about buying an electric car or van in 2016. Meanwhile, over half (55%) reported they had not thought about buying an electric car or van. Some 16% said they considered it, but decided not to buy one just yet.\n\nThe most significant barrier to buying an electric car, for many people, was related to the battery. This included the perceived lack of charging stations, and concerns that they won’t be able to recharge when they need to, or that the battery is limited to a distance that is too short.\n\nThe advent of new technologies, which can increase battery capacity and therefore the distance vehicles can travel on one charge, may convince motorists that electric is a more attractive option.\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n[UK energy: how much, what type, and where from?][4]\n[UK Perspectives 2016: How we travel][5]\n[UK Perspectives 2016: Energy and emissions][6]\n\n\n\nIf you like our Visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up][7] to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: [qualityoflife@ons.gov.uk][8] or [environment.accounts@ons.gov.uk][9]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/plan-for-roadside-no2-concentrations-published\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/08/petroldieselvehicles.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/08/envirotax.csv\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/ukenergyhowmuchwhattypeandwherefrom/2016-08-15\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/leisureandtourism/articles/ukperspectives2016howwetravel/2016-05-26\n  [6]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/uk-perspectives-2016-energy-and-emissions-in-the-uk//\n  [7]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n  [8]: mailto:qualityoflife@ons.gov.uk\n  [9]: environment.accounts@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

Today it was revealed that in the year ending March 2017 net migration (the balance between immigration – those entering the UK for a year or more, and emigration – those leaving the UK for a year or more) was estimated to be +246,000. Also, it was reported that across the UK 1 in 7 people were born outside the UK and 1 in 11 people were non-British nationals in 2016.\n\nBut the picture of migration is more complex; migration affects some local areas more than others. What do you think the levels are like in your local area?^1^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc430/quiz/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"How well do you know migration?\"/>\n\n[Download the data][2].\n\n###How much does the non-British population vary across the UK?\n\nThe map shows that the largest non-UK British populations are in the London area. In 2016 the five local authorities with the largest proportions of non-British nationals were all in London: Kensington and Chelsea (37% non-British nationals), Brent (34%), Westminster (34%), Newham (33%) and Ealing (32%). All of these local authorities are within London, which is the region with the largest proportion of non-British nationals residing (23%). The UK region with the lowest proportion of non-British nationals is North East England (4%). The map shows that the percentage of the non-British population is generally lower outside of London, and the lowest levels tend to be found in rural areas.\n\nOverall for the UK as a whole, the proportion of the non-British population was 9.3% (6.0 million of 64.7 million). Of this, 3.6 million were EU nationals, and 2.4 million were non-EU nationals.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc430/map/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Maps\"/>\n\nSource: [Office for National Statistics (ONS)][3]\n[Download the data][4].\n\n###How does your local area compare with the rest of the UK in terms of indicators of migration^1^?\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc430/barcode/barcodeGrouped/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Local Area Migration Indicators\"/>\n\n[Download the data][5].\n\n#####Notes:\n\n1. It is important to understand that these data sources measure different things; some measure flows and some measure stocks. There are definitional and coverage differences between the data sources and as such they are not directly comparable. More information is provided in the [Comparing sources of international migration statistics note][6].\n\n2. Net migration is the balance between immigration (those entering the UK for a year or more) and emigration (those leaving the UK for a year or more).\n\n3. The Short-Term International Migration (STIM) data in this release is based on the United Nations (UN) definition of a short-term migrant – “a person who moves to a country other than that of his or her usual residence for a period of at least 3 months but less than a year (12 months), except in cases where the movement to that country is for purposes of recreation, holiday, visits to friends or relatives, business, medical treatment or religious pilgrimage”.\n\n4. GP registration data excludes those migrants who move to a different local authority and register with a GP there, as they will only be registered as a migrant upon initial arrival to the UK, not when they subsequently move within the UK.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n[Migration, the European Union and work: How much do you really know?][7]\n[Explore 50 years of international migration to and from the UK][8]\n[What’s changed in the year since the Brexit vote?][9]\n\n\n\nIf you like our Visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up to our email alerts][10], selecting ‘stories and infographics’ under preferences.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/methodologies/methodologyguideformid2015ukpopulationestimatesenglandandwalesjune2016#international-migration\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/08/quizdata.csv\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/populationbycountryofbirthandnationalityreport/previousReleases\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/08/mapdata.csv\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/08/barcodedata-1.xlsx\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/comparingsourcesofinternationalmigrationstatistics/december2016\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/migrationtheeuropeanunionandworkhowmuchdoyoureallyknow/2017-07-19\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/explore50yearsofinternationalmigrationtoandfromtheuk/2016-12-01\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/articles/whatschangedsincethebrexitvote/2017-06-23\n  [10]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n  [11]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/migrationwithintheuk/datasets/localareamigrationindicatorsunitedkingdom\n  [12]: mailto:migstatsunit@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

Discussions will [include the future arrangements for residency, work, education, social security and healthcare][1] for UK citizens living in other EU countries and EU citizens living in the UK.\n\nWe’ve been looking at patterns of migration between the UK and Europe in a [series of articles called Living Abroad][2], and some journalists have noted that Brits living in France and Spain are older than the EU citizens living in the UK.\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc428a/dashboard/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Well-being dashboard\"/>\nAre we really “exporting” large numbers of retirees and pensioners to other EU countries?\n###Where to find the data\nThere are several possible ways to measure the number of Brits living in the EU. In January 2017, we published [What information is there on British migrants living in Europe?,][3] using data from the 2010 and 2011 national censuses published by the Eurostat Census hub.\n\nIn this article we use more up-to-date figures from the 2016 [EU Labour Force Survey][4] to provide an overview of the number of British citizens aged 65 and over living in other EU countries. Data on citizens of other EU countries living in the UK come from a 3-year-average dataset (2013 to 2015) of the ONS Annual Population Survey.\n\nWe’ll consider Ireland separately in a future article, as the UK’s unique relationship with Ireland – encompassing the Common Travel Area in place since 1922 and the right of people born in Northern Ireland to take up both Irish and British citizenship – makes it complex to identify those who may be affected by the UK’s decision to leave the EU. There are many dual nationals, and a further unknown number of people who have rights to both citizenships but have not yet exercised one of them.\n###Overall figures\nThe number of Brits aged 65 and over living in other EU countries is far greater than the number of EU citizens in the same age group living in the UK.\n\nThere are around 247,000 British citizens aged 65 and over living in other EU countries (excluding Ireland), and 85,000 people aged 65 and over from other EU countries (excluding Ireland) living in the UK.\n\nOlder British citizens living in the EU, and older EU citizens living in the UK, selected countries^1^\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc428/bars/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Cluster HORIZONTAL\"/>[Download the data][5]\n\nThere are 121,000 older Brits living in Spain, more than double the number 10 years ago. The number of people in this age group moving to Spain has not gone up significantly since 2008, so the recent increase is likely to be due to people who have lived there for many years getting older.\n\nItaly is the country whose older citizens living in the UK most outnumber the older people from Britain living there. There have historically been relatively high levels of migration from Italy, especially in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, and most people who moved to the UK in those years are now aged 65 and over. The older people from Poland who live in the UK, significantly outnumbering the number of older Brits living in Poland, are mainly long-term residents rather than more recent migrants.\n###Pensions\nThe people receiving the UK State Pension, [counted by the Department for Work and Pensions][6] (DWP), are a different group from those counted by the EU Labour Force Survey. This is because not everyone that receives a UK State Pension is a British citizen – it’s paid to anyone with qualifying National Insurance contributions or credits – and some people may register their address abroad with the DWP without being a long-term resident of that country.\n\nIn February 2017, the DWP paid State Pensions to around 340,000 pensioners living in other EU countries excluding Ireland.\n\nSome media reports have claimed that British pensioners are [“rushing to settle in EU countries ahead of Brexit”][7], while others report [pensioners considering returning to the UK][8] because of the falling value of the pound and uncertainty over their rights after the UK leaves the EU. In fact, the number of State Pension recipients living in other EU countries has risen steadily over the last 5 years, continuing a long-term trend.\n\nUK State Pension recipients resident in other EU countries (excluding Ireland), August 2012 to February 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc428/line/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK State Pension recipients resident in other EU countries (excluding Ireland), August 2012 to February 2017\"/>[Download the data][9]\n\nDuring this time the basic state pension has gone up every year, due to the “triple lock” policy of increasing its value by the highest of inflation, earnings or 2.5%. However, those spending their pension in the Eurozone countries will have seen their spending power rise and fall because of fluctuations in the exchange rate.\n\nIn the last 5 years, the value of the full basic State Pension reached a maximum of €164 per week in November 2015, before falling to €138 in July 2017.\n\nValue of full UK basic State Pension per week in euros and pounds (not adjusted for inflation), August 2012 to July 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc428/lines/figure4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Value of full UK basic State Pension per week in euros and pounds (not adjusted for inflation), August 2012 to July 2017\"/>\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc428/lines/figure5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Value of full UK basic State Pension per week in euros and pounds (not adjusted for inflation), August 2012 to July 2017\"/>[Download the data][10]\n\n\n\n###Other Visual.ONS articles\n[Migration, the European Union and Work: How much do you really know?][11]<br>\n[Holidays in the 1990s and now][12]<br>\n[The changing price of everyday goods and services][13]</br>\n\n\n\nIf you like our Visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up][14] to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/joint-technical-note-on-the-comparison-of-eu-uk-positions-on-citizens-rights\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/livingabroad/previousReleases\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/whatinformationisthereonbritishmigrantslivingineurope/jan2017\n  [4]: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/EU_labour_force_survey\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/08/datadownload.csv\n  [6]: https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml\n  [7]: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/british-pensioners-rushing-to-settle-move-eu-countries-ahead-of-brexit-france-spain-portugal-a7891606.html\n  [8]: http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-3720707/Meet-Costa-pensioners-determined-not-let-Brexit-ruin-retirement.html\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/08/data-2.csv\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/08/downloaddata.csv\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/migrationtheeuropeanunionandworkhowmuchdoyoureallyknow/2017-07-19\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/leisureandtourism/articles/holidaysinthe1990sandnow/2017-08-07\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/thechangingpriceofeverydaygoodsandservices/2017-07-11\n  [14]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n  [15]: mailto:digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.

      "markdown": "Many more people in England and Wales worry about being a victim of crime than will actually experience it.\n\nThe gap between the perception of crime and the risk of becoming a victim is particularly noticeable around robbery figures.\n\nONS figures showed that 0.3% of adults were victims of robbery in the year ending March 2016, but 9% of those surveyed were very worried they would experience it in the forthcoming year – 30 times higher than the rate of victimisation.\n\n####Trends in prevalence and worry about robbery, Crime Survey for England and Wales, years ending March 2009 to March 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc432charts/chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Trends in prevalence and worry about robbery, Crime Survey for England and Wales, years ending March 2009 to March 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data ][1]\n\nThe figures also showed that across all types of crime, women worried more about being a victim of crime than men.\n\n###Do you know your own risk of crime?\n\nWe’ve devised a crime calculator^1^ using three years’ worth of CSEW data, to give you an indication of how your own personal characteristics are related to the likelihood of becoming a victim of crime.\n\nUsing this tool, you can use your characteristics and those of your local area to see average victimisation rates for different types of crime, and see how these compare with national rates and your own perceptions of crime risk.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc432/content.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Crime Risk Calculator\"/>\n\n###Identity theft worries almost a quarter of people\nWhen thinking about some crimes, people’s perceptions and risk of being a victim are more closely aligned.\nThe crime that people were most worried about was identity theft (23.8%), followed by online crime (10%).\n\nThe CSEW showed that around one in 10 adults were victims of fraud and computer misuse offences in the year ending March 2016 and the majority of these incidents (67%), included an online element.\n\n####Proportion of adults very worried about online crime and identity theft by age, year ending March 2016 CSEW\n\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc432charts/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of adults very worried about online crime and identity theft by age, year ending March 2016 CSEW\"/>\n\n[Download the data][2]\n\n###Age changes what crime you worry about\nPeople in younger age groups tended to worry the least about some types of victimisation, with 16 to 34-year-olds the least worried about burglary, robbery and online crime.\n\nOlder age groups tended to worry more about possible victimisation, with 35 to 44-year-olds most concerned about burglary. The older age groups, spanning 55-64 year-olds and 65-74-year-olds were also most concerned about online crime and identity theft.\n\nThe figures on actual victimisation show a different pattern. The age group to suffer the [highest rate of crime][3] were 16 to 24 year olds; 19.6% within this group had been a victim of a crime and with 8.1% being a victim of personal crime^1^.\n\nThis compares with the oldest age group, 75 and over, who suffered the lowest proportions of crime overall and personal crime; 4.9% and 1.1% respectively.\n###A majority still believe national crime rates are increasing\nDespite crime dropping by 6% in the year ending March 2016 compared to the previous year (from 6.8 million incidents to 6.3 million), a majority of people still believed it had increased; 60% of adults believed crime had increased across the country.\n\nThis compares with 57% of adults in the previous year, and 84.1% in the year ending March 2009. In contrast, adults were more accurate in assessing trends in crime for their local area.\n\n####Adults who think crime has increased, 2009 to 2016, CSEW\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc432charts/chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Adults who think crime has increased, 2009 to 2016, CSEW\"/>\n\n[Download the data][4]\n\n###Risk of victimisation by crime type\nThe risk of victimisation for different groups also varies by crime type. The CSEW showed that victims of domestic violence and sexual assault were more likely to be women, while men and women had a similar likelihood of becoming a victim of theft from the person.\n\nMore generally, the rate of victimisation of crime varied across different groups in society, lifestyle factors like employment status and housing status can also be relevant.\n\n- Age: Younger adults were most likely to be victims of crime, whereas older people were least likely.\n- Sex: Men were more likely to have been a victim of violence, robbery and vehicle-related theft, than women. Women were twice as likely as men to be a victim of domestic violence and over five times as likely as men to have been sexually assaulted.\n- Employment status: Unemployed people were more likely to be victims of crime, compared with those in employment. Retired adults have a lower risk of burglary and vehicle-related theft than those in work. Students were almost twice as likely as to be victims of theft from the person than the average adult in England and Wales.\n- Housing tenure: Renters were more likely to be a victim of a violent crime, burglary or vehicle related theft than home owners.\n- Geographical area: Areas with higher rates of unemployment^2^ also had higher levels of burglary, criminal damage, other household theft and vehicle-related theft.\n \n###Other characteristics\nMany other characteristics also show relationships with victimisation^3^; these relationships tend to vary by crime type.\n\nFor example, while age and sex have a strong association with experiencing violent crime, figures show that these same characteristics display less association with fraud victimisation.\n\n\n####Notes: \n\n1. The calculations for this calculator are based on data from the CSEW victimisation survey, for the years ending March 2015 to March 2017, from the resident household population are asked about their experiences of crime over the preceding 12-month period.\n\n2. The crime calculator generates a figure based on the proportion of adults aged 16 and over (with characteristics similar to those you select) who said they had been a victim of crime.\n\n3. Fraud has not been included in the crime calculator because the most recent estimates, (published since June 2016), are experimental and subject to further development. Initial findings indicate that there was typically less variation in the types of victim, than in other types of crime: Overview of fraud statistics. The first full year-on-year comparisons of fraud crime statistics will be available in January 2018, following which trends in the data will begin to emerge.\n\n4. The Crime Domain of the English Indices of Deprivation (2010) and the Community Safety Domain of the Welsh Indices of Deprivation (2014) have been combined to provide a proxy of crime levels in various LSOAs. Local area definitions for the English and Welsh Indices of deprivation are based on Super Output Areas (SOAs). These are a set of geographical areas developed following the census to produce a set of areas of consistent size. LSOAs typically have a population of around 1,500.\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/09/Crime-data-download-chart-1.csv\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/09/Crime-data-download-chart-2.csv\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/crimeinenglandandwalesannualtrendanddemographictables\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/09/Crime-data-download-chart3.csv\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/internationalmigration/articles/migrationlevelswhatdoyouknowaboutyourarea/2017-08-24\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/marriagecohabitationandcivilpartnerships/articles/marriageanddivorceontheriseat65andover/2017-07-18\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/workplacepensions/articles/howareprivatepensionsaffectingtheincomeofretiredhouseholds/2017-08-08\n  [8]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n  [9]: mailto:crimestatistics@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1. Personal crime includes violence, robbery, theft from the person and other theft of personal property\n2. Unemployment levels have been measured for each Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) by means of the comparative level of employment deprivation (or involuntary unemployment) in the area based on the English Indices of Deprivation, 2015 and the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation, 2014.\n3. The relationship between characteristics and becoming a victim of crime is complex since many characteristics are interrelated and it is difficult to unpick these relationships. For example, students and young people were more likely to be victims of some types of crime, but since students are typically young people, it is difficult to know which characteristics are important when viewing them in isolation. Similarly those who are unemployed are more likely to be victims of some crimes but this could equally relate to the fact that they are also more likely to live in local areas with high unemployment (where relationships with victimisation have also been observed)."

      "markdown": "When someone takes their own life, the death is registered and we have a record of who they were, as well as where, when and how they died. These figures tell us that men, divorced people and those living in less well-off areas are at greater risk of suicide. But these facts only tell part of the story.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, there were 4,941 deaths recorded as suicide in England and Wales - but there are much larger numbers of people who consider taking their own lives.\n\nIn the same year, [Samaritans][1] volunteers had more than 770,000 contacts from people who expressed suicidal feelings. This included people thinking about suicide, making plans, or actively attempting it.\n\n\nAhead of [World Suicide Prevention Day ][2]on 10 September 2017, Samaritans told us the story of someone who considered suicide.\n###Kristian’s story\nKristian had lost both his parents by the time he was 12, leaving his grandparents to bring him up.\n\n“I shut away my grief and didn’t deal with it,” he said. “As I got older, it particularly affected my ability to form close relationships.”\n\nIn his 20s, Kristian was working as a teacher, and circumstances combined to make him feel very lonely and isolated. “Everyone around me seemed to be settling down with their partners, buying houses and it just wasn’t happening for me,” he said. He was being bullied at work, which intensified his feelings of unhappiness.\n\n“I started waking up at night and crying, and I had a lot of bad thoughts. I knew two people who had taken their own lives, and they had said they felt helpless, and I felt like that too.\n\n“I also had problems dealing with the comedown from drinking alcohol, and on one particular day I went to the gym the morning after, but couldn’t really do anything, so I ended up at the beach nearby. I was about the only person there apart from some surfers a quarter of a mile away. The tide was a long way out. I was crying, I felt I had had enough and thought no one could help me.\n\n“I started walking in to the waves, but when I had got quite a way in that made it real, and I started to panic that I couldn’t do it. I got myself out and something in my head went: ‘Call Samaritans’. I sat in my car, soaking wet and spoke to this man for 40 minutes. It probably saved my life.”\n\n\n###Suicide in England and Wales is declining\nSuicide is not as prevalent as it used to be. In England and Wales in 2016, there were 4,941 deaths recorded as suicide – fewer than in each of the previous three years.\n\nThe suicide rate – the number of deaths per 100,000 people – has been broadly declining since comparable records began in 1981, although between 2007 and 2013 (following the economic downturn) there was a rise in the suicide rate for men.\n\n####Suicide rates by sex, England and Wales, 1981 to 2016 registrations\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc431/chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Suicide rates by sex, England and Wales, 1981 to 2016 registrations\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][3]\n\nThe recent decline in the suicide rate is likely to be due to the suicide prevention work in England by the government, the NHS, charities, the British Transport Police and others. The [National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England][4] has included work to reduce the risk of suicide in high-risk groups. These include young and middle-aged men, people in the care of mental health services, and those in the criminal justice system.\n\nTo record a verdict of suicide, coroners must find “beyond reasonable doubt” that the person intended to end their life. Where this can’t be proved, coroners may record an open verdict, or find the death to have been caused by accident or misadventure^1^. For this reason, ONS includes in suicide statistics those deaths of “undetermined intent”.\n###Men at much greater risk of suicide\nSince around 1990, men have been at least three times as vulnerable to death from suicide as women. [Research by Samaritans][6] suggests that this greater risk is due to a complex set of reasons, including increased family breakdown leaving more men living alone; the decline of many traditionally male-dominated industries; and social expectations about masculinity:\n\n\"They have seen their jobs, relationships and identity blown apart. There is a large gap between the reality of life for such men and the masculine ideal.\"\n###Divorce and risk of suicide\nRelationship breakdown can also contribute to suicide risk. The greatest risk is among divorced men, who in 2015 were almost three times more likely to end their lives than men who were married or in a civil partnership. According to [research by Samaritans][7]:\n\n\"Divorce increases the risk of suicide because the individual becomes disconnected from their domestic relationship and social norms. In addition, within western societies there is a strong cultural emphasis on achieving a strong and happy marriage, and those who divorce may experience a deep sense of disorientation, shame, guilt and emotional hurt.”\n\n####Suicide rate by marital status, England and Wales, 2006 to 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc431/chart3M/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Suicide rate by marital status, England and Wales, 2006 to 2015\"/>\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc431/chart3F/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Suicide rate by marital status, England and Wales, 2006 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][8]\n###People in less well-off areas are more likely to end their lives\nPeople who live in more deprived areas - where there is less access to things like services, work and education^2^ -  are more at risk of suicide.\n\nPeople among the most deprived 10% of society are more than twice as likely to die from suicide than the least deprived 10% of society.\n\n####Suicide rate per deprivation decile, England, 2006 to 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc431/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Suicide rate per deprivation decile, England, 2006 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][10]\n\nPeople who work as carers, or in the arts, or as low-skilled workers, have a significantly higher risk of suicide than those in other occupations, according to our recent study of [suicide by occupation in England][11]. Men who work as skilled manual workers are at greater risk, as are female nurses, nursery and primary school teachers.\n\nThe lowest risk of suicide was found among corporate managers and directors, professionals including health professionals, and people working in customer service and sales.\n\n###Statistics and suicide prevention\nCompiling and publishing suicide statistics helps organisations like Samaritans do their work in preventing suicide by helping them to identify trends and vulnerable groups. Office for National Statistics also monitors emergent suicide methods, to advise policymakers on preventing these, and informs the government’s policy and strategy on suicide prevention.\n###Finding help\nYou can contact Samaritans on 116 123 (UK and Republic of Ireland; this number will not appear on your phone bill), email [jo@samaritans.org][12], or visit the [Samaritans website][13] to find details of the nearest branch.\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.samaritans.org/\n  [2]: https://iasp.info/wspd2017/\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/09/data.csv\n  [4]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/suicide-prevention-third-annual-report\n  [5]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20131205105739/http://www.archive2.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm58/5831/5831.pdf\n  [6]: http://www.samaritans.org/sites/default/files/kcfinder/files/press/Men%20Suicide%20and%20Society%20Research%20Report%20151112.pdf\n  [7]: http://www.samaritans.org/sites/default/files/kcfinder/files/press/Men%20Suicide%20and%20Society%20Research%20Report%20151112.pdf\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/09/data3.csv\n  [9]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/465791/English_Indices_of_Deprivation_2015_-_Statistical_Release.pdf\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/09/data2.csv\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/suicidebyoccupation/england2011to2015\n  [12]: mailto:jo@samaritans.org\n  [13]: https://www.samaritans.org/\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/articles/whatschangedsincethebrexitvote/2017-06-23\n  [15]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/areyourwageskeepingupwithinflation/2017-06-20\n  [16]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/shrinkflationandthechangingcostofchocolate/2017-07-24\n  [17]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n  [18]: mailto:digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n\n1.

      "markdown": "We are living longer than we did 100 years ago because of advances in medical science as well as better sanitation, nutrition and hygiene.\n\nJust over a century ago the [average life expectancy][1] at birth for a man was 48.4 years, whereas women could expect to live to 54.0.\n\nFast forward from 1915 to 2015 and a[ man’s life span][2] extended by 31 years and almost 29 years for a woman (79.3 and 82.9 respectively).\n###A change in the top cause of death\nThe top causes of death at the start of the 20th century were very different to those that we see today. This may partially be explained by improvements in medical knowledge that have led to a more comprehensive classification system.\n\nIn 1915, people were dying in large numbers from infections, but by 2015, the most common causes of death were related to cancer, heart conditions or external causes.\n\n####Top causes of death by age and sex, 1915 to 2015\nExplore the top cause of death, by age and sex, by dragging your cursor (or tap your finger) across a coloured square:\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc427/heatmap_m/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Top causes of death by age and sex, 1915 to 2015 Explore the top cause of death, by age and sex, by dragging your cursor (or tap your finger) across a coloured square:\"/>\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc427/heatmap_f/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"100 yrs Death\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3]\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Figures for deaths of those aged under one have been excluded from this chart.\n\n2. A full list of the top 10 underlying causes of death, with International Classification of Diseases (ICD codes), by age-group and sex can be found in the data download.\n\n\n\nBetween 1915 and 1945, infections were generally the leading cause of death for young and middle-aged males and females. For those aged one to four, infections remained the leading cause until 2005, with the exception of 1975 and 1985.\n\nThere was a dramatic decline in the number of people dying from infectious diseases in the 20th century. Poliomyelitis (polio), diptheria, tetanus, whooping cough, measles, mumps and rubella were all virtually wiped out during the second half of the 20th century, after childhood immunisation was introduced.\n\nMotor vehicle incidents began to emerge as a leading cause of death in young males and females in 1945. The number of road deaths of young people may be [attributable to the existence of the Blackout during World War II][4], when vehicles drove in total darkness. This trend continued until 1985, where the percentage of deaths to motor vehicle accidents began decreasing, perhaps due to the [introduction of compulsory seat belts in 1983][5].\n\nFrom 1985 onwards, external causes such as drug misuse, suicide and self-harm were the leading cause of death for young people, particularly affecting men more than women.\n\nMeanwhile heart conditions dominated as the leading cause of death for middle-to older-aged males from 1945 onwards. A similar trend was seen in females during this period, but at older ages; while younger to middle-aged females more frequently died of breast cancer.\n###Overall trends in deaths, 1915 to 2015\nNot only have the causes of death changed over time, but so have the number of people dying.\n\nThe number of deaths in England and Wales has decreased in the past century, whereas there has been an increase in the population; particularly the number of elderly people.\n\nIn 1915, there were 562,253 deaths in England and Wales, compared with 529,655 deaths in 2015, a decrease of 5.8%.\n\n####Deaths in England and Wales, 1915 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc427/figure2/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Deaths in England and Wales, 1915 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][6]\n\nNote: Figures do not include deaths to those whose usual residence is England or Wales and have died abroad, ie those serving and who died in the World Wars overseas.\n\n\n\nThe overall population of England and Wales rose by 64.0% between 1915 and 2015, from 35.3 million to 57.9 million. The population also aged considerably over this period, with 0.6% of the population aged 80 and over in 1915 compared with 4.8% in 2015.\n\nIn 1915, 47,946 people aged 80 and over died; by 2015, the number of deaths at this age had increased by 524.1% to 299,254 people.\n\n####Death rate by age, England and Wales, 1915 to 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc427/chart2rates/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Death rate by age, England and Wales, 1915 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n\nNote: Rates for those under one year old are deaths per 1,000 live births, rates for other ages are deaths per 1,000 population.\n\n\n\nHowever, the number of deaths per 1,000 of the population aged 80 and over decreased by 49.3% from 212.2 in 1915 to 107.5 in 2015.\n\nA similar pattern can be seen in infant deaths (under one year) where the deaths per 1,000 of live births decreased by 96.4% from 109.7 in 1915 to just 3.9 in 2015.\n###Considerable drop in the number of child deaths\nThe drop in the number of deaths for children aged four and under is a prime illustration of the dramatic change in childhood mortality over the century.\n\nIn 1915, there were 89,380 deaths of children aged under one, compared with just 2,721 in 2015. The number of deaths of one-to four-year-olds was 55,607 in 1915, while it was 460 in 2015.\n\n####Childhood death numbers, England and Wales, 1915 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc427/figure4/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Childhood death numbers, England and Wales, 1915 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][8]\n\n[Mass vaccination programmes][9] largely eradicated diseases that had killed thousands of children between 1915 and 2015.\n\nThe [improvements in mortality][10] were attributed to rising standards of living, especially improvements in nutrition and hygiene, in addition to the decline in deaths from airborne disease.\n\nOne hundred years from now, perhaps medical advances will have progressed further for us to live even longer.\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/adhocs/006833pastandprojecteddatafromtheperiodandcohortlifetables2014basedenglandandwales1841to2064\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/adhocs/0066682015singleyearnationallifetablesenglandscotlandwalesandnorthernireland\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/09/Top-10-data-download.xlsx\n  [4]: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/nov/01/blackout-britain-wartime\n  [5]: http://www.saferroads.org/advice/drivers/seatbelts/\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc427/data2.csv\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc427/data3.csv\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc427/data4.csv\n  [9]: http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/the-history-of-vaccination.aspx\n  [10]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160110132842/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/hsq/health-statistics-quarterly/no--18--summer-2003/index.html\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/peoplegreatlyoverestimatetheirlikelihoodofbeingrobbed/2017-09-07\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/whoismostatriskofsuicide/2017-09-07\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/workplacepensions/articles/howareprivatepensionsaffectingtheincomeofretiredhouseholds/2017-08-08\n  [14]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n  \n"

      "markdown": "Mothers with young children are more likely to go back to or begin full-time work now than 20 years ago, new ONS analysis suggests.\n\nThe proportion of mothers with children aged between three and four who are in employment increased by almost 10 percentage points over the past two decades. In England there are now around 133,000 more mothers, whose youngest child is a toddler, in employment in 2017 (65.1%), compared with 1997 (55.8%). This was largely driven by an increase in full-time employment.\n\nThis analysis comes as the government expanded the provision of free childcare from 15 to 30 hours a week in England. The policy is designed to help boost employment for parents, particularly mothers, looking to return to work or increase their working hours.\n\n####Percentage of mothers with a youngest child aged three or four years old who are in employment, England, 1997 to 2017\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc439/chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of mothers with a youngest child aged three or four years old who are in employment, England, 1997 to 2017\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][1]\n###More mothers with young children working full-time\nThe rise in overall employment for mothers has been driven mainly by an increasing number working in full-time employment. The proportion of mothers working part-time when they have young children has remained relatively static over the period, although it remains much higher than those working full-time.\n\n####Percentage of mothers with a youngest child aged three or four years old, who are in full-time and part-time employment, England, 1997 to 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc439/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of mothers with a youngest child aged three or four years old, who are in full-time and part-time employment, England, 1997 to 2017\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][2]\n\nHowever, mothers with young children have the lowest employment levels of all parents with dependent children at 65.1%. In comparison, the employment rate of fathers with children aged three or four is 93.2%.\n###More fathers with young children working part-time\nThe introduction of flexible working practices and shared parental leave have also made it easier for fathers to share childcare responsibilities. ONS data reflects this social change to an extent. There is a marked increase in the number of fathers who have young children working part-time - it has almost doubled from 3.9% in 1997 to 6.9% in 2017.\n\n####Percentage of fathers with a youngest child aged three or four years old, who work full-time and part-time, England, 1997 to 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc439/chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of fathers with a youngest child aged three or four years old, who work full-time and part-time, England, 1997 to 2017\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][3]\n\nHowever, this is still well below the proportion of women with young children working part-time - 38.2% in 2017. Generally, the rate of men with young children working full-time has remained stable, and their overall employment is less affected by parenthood compared with women.\n###Policy changes may have affected parental employment\nThe doubling of free childcare from 15 hours a week to 30 hours in England is just one of a larger number of initiatives designed to improve education, make childcare more affordable, and to encourage parents back into work.\n\n####Percentage of mothers working full-time and part-time by age of youngest child, England, 1996 to 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc439/dist/distribution/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of mothers working full-time and part-time by age of youngest child, England, 1996 to 2017\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][4]\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/09/chart1-1.csv\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/09/chart2-1.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/09/chart3-1.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/12/distchart-3.csv\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/workplacepensions/articles/howareprivatepensionsaffectingtheincomeofretiredhouseholds/2017-08-08\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/marriagecohabitationandcivilpartnerships/articles/marriageanddivorceontheriseat65andover/2017-07-18\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/articles/unpaidcarersprovidesocialcareworth57billion/2017-07-10\n  [8]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n"

Young adults (aged between 16 and 24) who were abused during childhood were most likely to have experienced domestic abuse in the previous year^5^.\n\n####Proportion of adults who experienced domestic abuse in the last year, by experience of abuse as a child and by age, CSEW year ending March 2016\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc442/Abuse/DomesticAbuse3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of adults who experienced domestic abuse in the last year, by experience of abuse as a child and by age, CSEW year ending March 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][6]\n###Adult survivors of child abuse and levels of health and well-being\nThe analysis shows that adult survivors of childhood abuse were more likely to have taken illegal drugs in the last year than those who had not experienced abuse as a child (12% compared with 8%).\n\nThey were also almost twice as likely to report having a long-standing illness or disability compared with those who were not abused as a child (28% compared with 15%)^6^.\n\nAt the same time, 78% of child abuse survivors said their health, in general, was \"very good\" or \"good\", compared with 87% of those who did not experience abuse as a child.\n\nSurvivors of childhood abuse rated their well-being as lower than adults who did not experience abuse as a child.

You can reach them on 0808 802 9999\n\n\n\n###Other research\nPrevious research has looked into the impact of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) on later life. These are stressful experiences during childhood and include abuse, neglect and growing up in a household with mental illness or alcohol or drug abuse. The research has primarily focused on the impact of these experiences on health and well-being, finding that they can lead to adopting health harming behaviours, such as smoking, and can have life-long consequences to health, for example [National household survey of Adverse childhood experiences and their relationship with resilience to health-harming behaviors in England][16] and [Adverse Childhood Experiences and their impact on health-harming behaviours in the Welsh adult population][17].\n\nOther research, looking at the implications of child abuse and maltreatment, has also shown similar findings. A literature review for the NSPCC , called the [Costs and Consequences of Child Maltreatment][18] found that these experiences as a child could have many different implications on the individual in later life, such as forming and maintaining relationships, mental health problems and an increased likelihood of experiencing violent treatment from an intimate partner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/adhocs/007527impactofchildabuseonlaterlifecrimesurveyforenglandandwalesyearendingmarch2016\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/09/chart1-2.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/09/chart2-2.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/09/Abuse-cycle-diagram.png\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/09/chart3-2.csv\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/09/chart4-1.csv\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/09/chart5-1.csv\n  [8]: http://www.napac.org.uk/\n  [9]: http://www.havoca.org\n  [10]: http://www.thesurvivorstrust.org\n  [11]: http://www.victimsupport.org.uk\n  [12]: http://www.nspcc.org.uk\n  [13]: http://www.childline.org.uk\n  [14]: http://www.mind.org.uk\n  [15]: https://rapecrisis.org.uk/centres.php\n  [16]: https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-12-72\n  [17]: http://www.cph.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ACE-Report-FINAL-E.pdf\n  [18]: https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/research-reports/costs-and-consequences-child-maltreatment.pdf\n  [19]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/peoplegreatlyoverestimatetheirlikelihoodofbeingrobbed/2017-09-07\n  [20]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/whoismostatriskofsuicide/2017-09-07\n  [21]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/causesofdeathover100years/2017-09-18\n  [22]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n\n\n####Footnotes:\n\n1.

There are more than three times as many women working part-time than men, and part-time jobs tend to be lower paid.\n\nBut a pay gap of 9% remains for full-time workers^3^, with women earning less than men in every occupation group (even those where women outnumber men). \n\nWomen are much more likely than men to work in low-paid sectors like care and leisure, as well as in administrative and secretarial jobs. Four out of five full-time care and leisure roles are performed by women, but these women earn 9% less per hour, on average, than their male counterparts^4^.\n\nWomen hold nearly half (45%) of full-time \"professional occupations\" – including scientists, engineers and health professionals –  yet their hourly earnings are 11% lower, on average, than men.\n\nMeanwhile, men are more likely than women to work in highly paid occupations, like managers, directors and senior officials, where women earn 16% less per hour on average. Men also hugely outnumber women in skilled trades: jobs like farmers, mechanics, electricians and chefs. In this occupation group, there is a larger pay gap (25%) in favour of men.\n###Women working full-time earn less, on average, than men in all major occupation groups \n####Difference between proportions of men and women in full-time employment, and gender pay gap per hour, by occupation group\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc446/fulltime/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Difference between proportions of men and women in full-time employment, and gender pay gap per hour, by occupation group\"/>\n\n[Download the data][1]\n\nWe see a similar trend when looking at specific jobs. Hover over the jobs below to see the gender pay gap alongside the split in employment.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc446/explorer/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"What is the gender pay gap for your job?\"/>\n\n[Download the data][2]\n\nIn jobs where men outnumber women, including solicitors, assemblers and medical practitioners, there is generally a large pay gap in favour of men.\n\nA pay gap in favour of men remains for full-time primary and nursery schoolteachers, despite the fact that five out of six are women.

The nine major occupation groups are in accordance with Standard Occupational Classification 2010 (SOC 2010). When comparing pay within these groups, we're not necessarily comparing men and women in identical jobs.\n2. The gender pay gap is calculated as the difference between median hourly earnings (excluding overtime) of men and women as a proportion of median hourly earnings (excluding overtime) of men.\n3. For the Labour Force Survey (LFS), the split between full-time and part-time employment is based on respondents' self-classification. For the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), full-time is defined as employees working more than 30 paid hours per week (or 25 or more for the teaching professions).\n4. The proportions of men and women employed in each occupation and the gender pay gap are calculated using the total number of employees. This excludes those in self-employment.\n5. The employment splits in the interactive differ from those in this article because they're sourced from ASHE, as opposed to LFS."

      "markdown": "The UK has dropped several ranks in the European Union rankings of child mortality since 1990, recent analysis of WHO^1^ and ONS data^2^ has found. \n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">\n###What is the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal?\nEnsure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.\n\n###Target: \nBy 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under five years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-five mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.\n</ons-box>\n\nThe data for both indicators show that although the UK met the global target some 40 years ago, the rate of improvement has slowed compared with other EU countries, which are making faster progress. The Department of Health committed to halving [the rate of stillbirths and infant deaths in England by 2030.][1]\n###Neonatal mortality\nThe neonatal mortality rate indicates the probability of dying in the first 28 days of life. In 1990, the UK was seventh in the European Union with a neonatal mortality rate of 4.5 deaths per 1,000 live births. Germany, Sweden, France, Finland, Luxembourg and Denmark were ahead of the UK with lower neonatal mortality rates. The worst performing countries were Romania, Hungary and Estonia, which had neonatal mortality rates of 13.5, 13.6 and 13.8 respectively.\n\nYet by 2015, Estonia had managed to overtake the UK, coming in at fifth place with a rate of 1.5, while the UK was pushed back to 19th with a slightly higher rate of 2.7. Other countries with a similar neonatal mortality rate to the UK include Croatia (2.6) , Lithuania and Denmark (both at 2.5), and Spain (2.8).\n\n####Neonatal mortality rankings, European Union countries, 1990 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc448/slope/neonatal/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Neonatal mortality rankings, European Union countries, 1990 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data][2]\n\nOut of all 28 European Union countries, the UK made less progress in these 25 years than all of them, apart from Germany and France.\n###Under-five mortality\nThe under-five mortality rate is the probability of dying between birth and five years of age per 1,000 live births.\n\nIn 1990, the UK was ninth out of all European Union countries, with an under-five mortality rate of 9.3. Other countries ahead of the UK included Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands. The countries with the highest rates were Romania (37.7), Bulgaria (22.1) and Latvia (20.4).\n\nAs of 2015, the UK is 20th with a rate of 4.5. In this time, Estonia had again risen in the rankings compared with the UK, reducing its under-five mortality rate from 20.2 to 2.9. It also outpaced the Netherlands and Sweden, which in 2015 had rates of 3.8 and 3.0 respectively.\n\nCountries with a similar under-five mortality rate to the UK in 2015 include Greece (4.6) and France and Croatia, which (both 4.3).\n\n####Under-five mortality rankings, European Union countries, 1990 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc448/slope/under5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Under-five mortality rankings, European Union countries, 1990 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3]\n\nOut of all 28 European Union countries, the UK made less progress in under-five mortality than all other countries, apart from Malta.\n###Global child mortality rates\nHow does the UK compare to other countries globally? We're one of 110 countries that have met the global target of fewer than 12 deaths per 1,000 live births for neonatal mortality. For under-five mortality, we are one of 114 countries who have reached the global target of fewer than 25 deaths per 1,000 live births. While progress has been made globally, and many countries now have very low child mortality rates, lots more will need to be done to meet the global target.\n\nSan Marino has the lowest neonatal mortality rate (0.7) although as it is so small it is to be expected. Iceland is second lowest (0.9). Angola has the highest rate (48.7).\n\nLuxembourg - also a small country - has the lowest under-five mortality rate (1.9) and Iceland has the second lowest (2). Again, Angola has the highest rate of under-five mortality (156.9).\n\nHave a look at our interactive to see how individual country rates have changed over time.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc448/multiline/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Neonatal and Under-five Mortality rates\"/>\n\n[Download the data for under-five][4]\n\n[Download the data for neonatal][5]\n\n###About the Sustainable Development Goals\nThe UK agreed to the Sustainable Development Goals in 2016, along with 192 other UN member states. These countries all committed to work towards ending hunger and poverty, halting climate change and reducing inequalities. In the run-up to the UK’s first publication around Sustainable Development Goals, due 9 November 2017, we're publishing a series that looks at some of the major goals, and how the UK is performing in meeting them.\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-ambition-to-halve-rate-of-stillbirths-and-infant-deaths\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/10/neonataldatafordownload.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/10/under5datafordownload.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/10/globalunder5.csv\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/10/globalneonatal.csv\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/causesofdeathover100years/2017-09-18\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/articles/trendsinbirthsanddeathsoverthelastcentury/2015-07-15\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/peoplegreatlyoverestimatetheirlikelihoodofbeingrobbed/2017-09-07\n  [9]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n  [10]: mailto:digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1. WHO states that the mortality rates on the Global Health Observatory have been estimated by applying methods to all Member States to the available data from Member States, that aim to ensure comparability of across countries and time; hence they are not necessarily the same as the official national data.\n2. WHO data has been used for international comparisons, except the UK, where ONS data has been used to ensure that figures reported here align with the data on our national reporting platform (to be launched shortly).  There may be instances where WHO data differs to other countries' official national data due to their estimations on forecasting and adjustments. Although WHO data for the UK differs slightly to ONS data, the picture of the UK remains more or less the same."

A lot has changed in the last 60 years: we are living much longer; attitudes to sex and marriage have become more relaxed; house prices have risen and the demographics of the country have changed. But do you know by how much?\n\n\nWe've teamed up with [BBC News][2] to use statistics to tell the story of the last 60 years.\n\nTest your knowledge by drawing in the missing information on the charts below. The charts give you the latest figure – all you have to do is tap and drag the orange dot on each graph and draw the rest of the chart back to 1957, then use the \"Show me the answer\" button to see how you did.\n\n<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/10/dyoexample.gif\"/>\n\n<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/10/today_ons_house_prices.png\"/>\n###How low were house prices in 1957?^1^\nHouse prices have rocketed over the last few decades.

A baby boy born in the UK in 2014 could expect, on average, to live to 79; for baby girls born that year it was 83. But what do you think the average life expectancy was for a boy born in 1957?

      "markdown": "The financial relationship between the UK and the European Union (EU) continues to be a talking point.\n\nIn 2018 the government spent £864.9 billion on all aspects of public spending, but how much does the UK pay to the EU as a current member? \n\nWhat about the adjustment (officially known as the ‘Fontainbleau abatement’, colloquially known as the UK rebate) deducted from the overall theoretical liability, and the net impact of money the UK receives from the EU, for example, through the Agricultural Guarantee Fund?\n\nFollowing our previous explainer on this topic, we take another look using latest numbers on the UK’s official transactions with European Union (EU) institutions using data consistent with Table 9.9 of Pink Book 2019 (available in Table 1), as well as data from the European Commission. The rest of the [Pink Book][1] will be published as scheduled on 31 October 2019.\n\nIn 2018 the UK’s gross contribution to the EU amounted to £20.0 billion; however, this amount of money was never actually transferred to the EU. It is best thought of as a theoretical liability.    \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc685/1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"In 2018 the UK’s gross contribution to the EU amounted to £20.0 billion\"/>\n\nThis is because before the UK government transfers any money to the EU, the adjustment (or abatement) is applied.\n\nIn 2018 the UK abatement was £4.5 billion. This means £15.5 billion was transferred from the UK government to the EU in official payments.   \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc685/2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"In 2018 the UK abatement was £4.5 billion\"/>\n\nBut this only accounts for the money that the UK pays to the EU – some of this £15.5 billion is credited back to the UK public sector, of which a proportion is then paid to the private sector.\n\nThe EU pays money to the UK public sector to administer what are known as “shared management” programmes. Under these, the EU makes payments to the UK authorities, which are then distributed in accordance with EU rules, for example, to farmers.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) reports that £4.5 billion came back to the UK public sector in credits in 2018. This included £2.2 billion that came through the [Agricultural Guarantee Fund][2] and £0.7 billion that came back through the [European Regional Development Fund][3]. \n\nGiven these figures, the ONS reports that the UK government's net contribution to the EU – that is, the difference between the money it paid to the EU and the money it received – was £11.0 billion in 2018 compared with the £20.0 billion theoretical liability.   \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc685/3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The ONS reports that the UK government's net contribution to the EU was £11.0 billion in 2018\"/>\n\nBut is there anything else we might consider?\n\nSome have argued that there are other payments that should be considered. The private sector is able to access funding directly from the EU, but these are not considered “official transactions”. The net figure (usually published as part of the Pink Book, available in Table 1) only considers payments the UK government receives from the EU, not payments that the EU makes directly to the UK private sector such as grants to universities. \n\nWhile the Pink Book table is not designed to capture those payments, the European Commission (EC) provides net figures including payments to the UK public and private sector.\n\nData from the [European Commission][4] (EC) does account for some credits to the private sector. Let's now take a look at how it calculates the UK's contribution using its own figures.   \n\n####European Commission figures, five-year average, 2014 to 2018, £billion \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc685/4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"European Commission figures, five-year average, 2014 to 2018, Â£billion\"/>\n\n[Download the data][5]\n\n####Notes:\n1. Averages have been calculated using unrounded values.\n\n\nUsing the latest available figures [published by the EC][6], a wider estimate of flows between the UK and the EU can be calculated. This calculation considers the abatement, the money the EU sends to the UK government, and the money the EU sends directly to the UK private sector.\n\nThis is arguably a more complete picture of the money that flows between the UK and the EU and in 2018 the net flow was £8.6 billion.\n\nHowever, in the last few years the EC figures have been volatile and so a five-year average has been taken to better represent a “typical” contribution.\n\nThe UK’s annual five-year average (2014 to 2018) net contribution on this wider basis was £7.8 billion; lower than the £9.8 billion ONS estimate of the annual five-year average which only captures official transactions between the EU and the UK government.\n\n###Making meaning of large amounts\nOften, very large numbers can lose meaning – to help you make sense of them we have created a calculator tool that will break the numbers down for you.\n\n####Context Calculator\n\nThis handy calculator is here to help you make meaning of the many large numbers used in the EU debate, particularly the figures on the UK's net contribution to the EU.\n\nClick on either of the two buttons - or just type in a figure - and it will break it down for you.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc685/calculator/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"This handy calculator is here to help you make meaning of the many large numbers used in the EU debate particularly the figures on the UK's net contribution to the EU. Click on either of the two buttons - or just type in a figure - and it will break it down for you.\"/>\n\n\n###The UK contribution over time\nThe UK’s contribution to the EU budget changes each year as it is dependent on various factors, such as UK gross national income (GNI), the GNI of other EU member states and the size of the Value Added Tax (VAT) base. \n\nHere, using ONS figures we take a look at how the UK contribution (after deducting the abatement) has changed since the start of the decade.  \n\n####UK contributions to the EU budget (after deducting the abatement), £ billions, 2010 to 2018\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc685/stacked-bar-vertical/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK contributions to the EU budget (after deducting the abatement), Â£ billions, 2010 to 2018\"/>\n\n[Download the data][7]\n\n\n###Notes\n\nIn the calendar year 2018, total general [government expenditure][8] was £864.9 billion. Here we have used a wide definition, which includes spending on healthcare, education, defence, and spending on social security benefits. Central government spending and local government spending are both included. The amount covers the whole of the UK.\n\nHM Treasury also [publishes figures][9] on the payments between the EU and the UK government and estimated the net contribution in 2018 to be £8.9 billion. Its figures differ to those reported by the ONS as they are estimates, compared with the final figures used in the ONS publication. Treasury figures are also presented on a cash basis, whereas ONS data are presented on an accruals basis.\n\nEuropean Commission figures are from the data download in their [financial report][10] and have been converted into sterling using the annual average exchange rate for each year from the Bank of England website. They account for all payments it receives from the UK government and payments it makes to the UK public and private sector bodies. \n\nA small proportion of spending – just over 2% – cannot be allocated to a specific country and so are not included in the EC’s figures. There are also some payments to the EC that are not allocated to a particular country and are therefore also not included in their figures. An example of this is fines, which is again a small proportion of total spending, typically between 2% and 3% of total expenditure.\n\n[Some commentators][11] highlight the complexity in capturing the UK’s financial relationship with the EU. Another important point to consider is that the UK may still be committed to certain types of spending even after leaving the EU, so there may be current contributions that may not be saved. This may include, for example, spending towards overseas aid. In 2018 the [Department for International Development][12] paid £452 million in overseas aid via EU institutions while, in total, the UK government paid £951 million; all of which counted towards our overseas aid spending target.\n\n<ons-table-v2 path=\"/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/articles/theukcontributiontotheeubudget/2017-10-31/23b269c2\" />\n \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/previousReleases\n  [2]: https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-funding_en\n  [3]: https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/funding/erdf/\n  [4]: https://ec.europa.eu/budget/graphs/revenue_expediture.html\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc685/datadownloads/contribution.csv\n  [6]: http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc685/datadownloads/contributions-over-time.csv\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicspending/bulletins/ukgovernmentdebtanddeficitforeurostatmaast/march2019\n  [9]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/european-union-finances-2018\n  [10]: https://ec.europa.eu/budget/graphs/revenue_expediture.html\n  [11]: https://fullfact.org/europe/brexit-extension-1-billion/\n  [12]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statistics-on-international-development-final-uk-aid-spend-2018"

For instance, men in the Hampshire town of Hart, the least deprived local authority in England, outlive men in the most deprived area, Blackpool, by almost eight years. Women in Hart outlive their female peers in Blackpool by almost seven years. \n\n\n<ons-box align=\"right\">\n###What is deprivation?\n\nDeprivation is an overall measure based on factors such as income, employment, health and education within an area.\n</ons-box>\n\n\n###Heart disease was the biggest killer of men\nThe leading cause of death for males in both England and Wales in 2016 was heart disease, with more than 32,000 deaths in England and more than 2,300 in Wales. More people in deprived areas died as a result of heart disease, and more men suffered than women. \n\n[Risk factors][4] such as a poor diet and lack of exercise increase the chances of a person developing a form of heart disease compared to someone who leads a healthy lifestyle.\n\n####Number of deaths as a result of heart disease, 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc453/bar-graphs/Heart_Disease/index.html\" title=\"Ischaemic Heart Disease\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][5]\n###Dementia and Alzheimer’s was the biggest killer of women\nFor women in England and Wales combined, the leading cause of death was dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, with more than 41,000 women dying from this cause in 2016. This was almost double the number of men who died as a result of these diseases.\n\nThere was a higher number of deaths as a result of dementia and Alzheimer's among those living in mid-deprived areas of England, and in Wales.\n\nDementia and Alzheimer’s disease are [not fully understood][6], and at present there is no cure. There are treatments available to slow down the effects of the diseases and [NHS research][7] suggests that some lifestyle factors like diabetes and smoking, which are linked with cardiovascular disease, can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. \n\nAccording to [Alzheimer's Research UK,][8] age is the biggest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and dementia.\n\n####Number of deaths as a result of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc453/bar-graphs/Dementia/\" title=\"Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][9]\n\nOverall, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, and heart disease were the two leading causes of death in both England, and in Wales in 2016.\n###The trend in deprivation and deaths\nThe top 10 leading causes of death were the same for males and females in both England and Wales, although in a slightly different ranking order. After heart disease, dementia and Alzheimer's disease, for men the third-biggest killer was lung cancer, and for women it was cerebrovascular diseases.\n###Lung cancer\nCancers or tissue growths (neoplasms) in the trachea, bronchus and/or lung were a major cause of death for men in 2016, with approximately 16,500 deaths compared with nearly 14,000 deaths among women in both England and Wales combined. In the most deprived areas, men are twice as likely to die from these cancers compared with the least deprived areas.\n\nIn 85% of [cases where a patient has lung cancer][10], smoking is the biggest risk factor. However, people who have never smoked can also develop this disease.\n\n####Number of deaths as a result of lung cancer, 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc453/bar-graphs/Lung_cancer/\" title=\"Lung cancer\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][11]\n###Strokes and brain haemorrhages \nFor women, the third most common cause of death was cerebrovascular diseases, which includes strokes and brain haemorrhages.\n\nResponsible for nearly 19,000 female deaths and approximately 14,000 male deaths in England, and in Wales combined, cerebrovascular diseases caused higher numbers of deaths in the mid-deprived areas. The exact causes of strokes and haemorrhages are not known, but there are [risk factors ][12]such as smoking and inactivity that increase the risk of developing these diseases. \n\n####Number of deaths as a result of cerebrovascular diseases, 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc453/bar-graphs/Cerebrovascular/\" title=\"Cerebrovascular Disease\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][13]\n###Respiratory diseases\nRanking highly for both men and women across both England and Wales were chronic lower respiratory diseases like emphysema and chronic bronchitis, which were much more prevalent causes of death in more deprived areas.\n\n[Causes of respiratory diseases][14] include smoking, pollution and exposure to dangerous substances. \n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type of respiratory disease. According to the NHS, [smoking is thought to be responsible for 9 out of 10 cases.][15]\n\n[People who work][16] around exhaust fumes and substances such asbestos and silica are at a much higher risk of developing a respiratory disease.\n\n####Number of deaths as a result of respiratory diseases, 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc453/bar-graphs/Chronic_Resp/\" title=\"Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][17]\n###Leading causes specific to males and females\nWhen looking at sex-specific leading causes of deaths, female deaths from breast cancer and male deaths from prostate cancer are more prevalent in areas of mid to low deprivation levels in England.\n\nThis trend can't be seen as clearly in Wales, but there is a slight pattern of higher occurrences of death in mid-deprived areas.\n\nThe reasons as to why women develop [breast cancer][18] and why men develop [prostate cancer][19] are unclear but there are many risk factors associated with both cancers. One of these is age. As a person gets older, the risk of developing one of these cancers increases.

      "markdown": "Concerns about [“inflation over target”][1]^1^ and [\"limited\" slack in the economy][3] have prompted the Bank of England to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. \n\n\nAt noon today (2 November 2017), the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 7-2 in favour of raising the interest rate to 0.5%, from a record low of 0.25%.\n\nThe majority of the MPC agreed that now was the right time to raise interest rates [“to return inflation sustainably to the target][4]”.\n\nBut the Committee acknowledged that \"uncertainties associated with Brexit are weighing on domestic activity\". Some economists, including former MPC member David Blanchflower, had [warned][5] against an interest rate rise.\n###What’s changed since the last interest rate rise?\nThe last time we saw a rise in the interest rate was 5 July 2007. To put that into context, Tony Blair had recently resigned as Prime Minister and the first iPhone had just been released.\n\nOn that day, the Bank voted for a higher interest rate against a backdrop of a [“strong global economy”][6]. The rate had risen twice that year already and there was little sign of the impending financial crisis. \n\nBut between the last interest rate rise and today, the MPC had met 118 times and decided against raising interest rates on every occasion. \n\nWhen setting interest rates, the MPC considers many factors including debt, savings, inflation, economic growth, employment and wages. They’ll also look at conditions in economies and financial markets worldwide.\n\nSo how similar is the situation today compared with 2007? We’ve gathered some of the main indicators and compared the latest data points with those that were available on 5 July 2007 - when the Bank last chose to raise the interest rate.\n\nSelect higher or lower for each indicator and find out what’s changed in the last decade.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc452ir/q1/Line/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Was the rate of inflation higher or lower in 2007?\"/>\n\n[Download the data][7]\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc452ir/q2/Line/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Was the rate of economic growth higher or lower in 2007?\"/>\n\n[Download the data][8]\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc452ir/q3/Line/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Was the unemployment rate higher or lower in 2007?\"/>\n\n[Download the data][9]\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc452ir/q4/Line/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Was real pay higher or lower in 2007?\"/>\n\n[Download the data][10]\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc452ir/q5/Line/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Was the household saving ratio higher or lower in 2007?\"/>\n\n[Download the data][11]\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc452ir/q6/Line/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Was growth of consumer credit higher or lower in 2007?\"/>\n\n[Download the data][12]\n###Why has the interest rate stayed so low for so long?\nAfter rising to 5.75% in July 2007, the Bank of England base rate was subsequently cut nine times in the next two years as the financial crisis took effect.\n\nIt reached a record low of 0.5% in March 2009 and remained at that level, partly because of the long-lasting impact of the crisis, before dropping again to 0.25% in August 2016.\n###The economy took much longer to recover from this recession compared with previous ones, which kept interest rates low\nPrevious recessions, number of quarters taken for GDP to reach pre-recession level\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc452ir/chart1/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The economy took much longer to recover from this recession compared with previous ones, which kept interest rates low\"/>\n\n[Download the data][13]\n\nBut the general downward trend in interest rates goes back further than the last decade.

When we do take these things into account we get a better idea of relative pay between private and public sector employees.\n\n\"This is done using mean pay per hour (excluding overtime), so not taking into account number of hours worked or additional benefits like pension contributions, company cars or health insurance.\"\n###Are public sector workers getting poorer?\nRecent research has suggested that some public sector workers are [thousands of pounds worse off compared with 2010][3], before the introduction of limits on public sector pay. \n\n<ons-box align=\"right\">\nUse our [calculator][4] to find out whether your wages are keeping up with inflation. \n</ons-box>\n\nBecause of the restrictions on pay, inflation has generally outpaced public sector pay growth since 2011, meaning that public sector workers have grown poorer in real terms over the last six years.\n\nWith inflation currently at its highest since April 2012, the government has recently [lifted the 1% pay cap][5] for some workers.\n###Public sector pay growth and inflation, 2006 to 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc455/differenceline/pub-vs-ciph.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Public sector pay growth and inflation, 2006 to 2017\"/>\n\n[Download the data][6].\n\nAs well as seeing their pay rise more slowly than inflation, public sector workers have lost ground relative to the private sector since 2013.\n###Public and private sector pay growth, 2006 to 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc455/differenceline/pub-vs-private.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Public and private sector pay growth, 2006 to 2017\"/>\n[Download the data][7].\n\nPay in the public sector has risen by an average of 1.1% per year since April 2011, below private sector pay (2.1%) and inflation (1.9%), but above the 1% cap. \n\nWhy has pay grown by more than 1%? Because there’s been a notable shift in the makeup of the public sector in recent years, which isn’t captured by looking at average pay or pay growth alone.\n###The public sector workforce is shrinking, with some lower paid jobs shifting to the private sector\nThere were 5.4 million public sector workers in June 2017, down by 16% from 6.4 million in September 2009.\n\nDuring the financial crisis of 2008 to 2009, around 250,000 workers joined the public sector as Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland were nationalised.\n\nHowever, since the recession, the public sector has lost chunks of its workforce to the private sector.\n###Size of public sector workforce, 2006 to 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc455/employees/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Size of public sector workforce, 2006 to 2017\"/>\n\n[Download the data][8].\n\nThe net result is that the proportions of public sector jobs within specific professions has changed. Nearly 30% of public sector workers were employed in health and social care in 2010, increasing to 34% in 2017.  \n\nHealth and social care is a relatively well-paid profession in the public sector, with average weekly earnings of £555 in September 2017. Education professionals earn much less per week on average (£413).\n\nThe earnings gap between education and other public sector areas - public administration and health and social work - has grown over time. It widened particularly in 2012 when sixth form and further education corporations in England moved to the private sector.\n###Mean weekly pay by public sector area, 2000 to 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc455/sectorpay/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Mean weekly pay by public sector area, 2000 to 2017\"/>\n\n[Download the data][9].\n\n###Since the recession, London is the only UK region to have seen a rise in public sector employment\nWhile public sector employment has contracted across the UK as a whole, London is the only region to have seen an increase. Average public sector weekly earnings in London are nearly 30% greater than the next-highest paying region (Scotland), so this increase has dragged up the average across the UK.\n###Change in public sector employment between 2008 and 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc455/Regional-Map-Bar/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Change in public sector employment between 2008 and 2017\"/>\n[Download the data][10].\n###Public sector employees are more experienced and higher skilled than before\nPublic sector workers are staying in their jobs for longer than before, with the average rising from 8.7 years in 2004 to 9.8 years in 2017. In contrast, private sector workers are less experienced, having stayed in their jobs for an average of 6.7 years in 2017 (compared with 6.4 years in 2004). The longer someone stays in their job, the more they earn on average.\n\nMeanwhile, whereas the skill profile of jobs in the private sector has remained broadly unchanged over time (45.7% high-skilled jobs in 2004 compared with 47.6% in 2017), the public sector workforce has become more skilled.\n###Skill level of public sector service jobs, 1997 to 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc455/skilllevel/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Skill level of public sector service jobs, 1997 to 2017\"/>\n\n[Download the data][11].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/analysisoffactorsaffectingearningsusingannualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2016\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/11/data-model-1.csv\n  [3]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40626676\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/areyourwageskeepingupwithinflation/2017-06-20\n  [5]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41241295\n  [6]: /visualisations/dvc455/data-for-download/data-difference.csv\n  [7]: /visualisations/dvc455/data-for-download/data-difference.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/11/data-employees.csv\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/11/data-sector.csv\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/11/data-regions.csv\n  [11]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/11/data-skill-1.csv\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/explorethegenderpaygapandtestyourknowledge/2017-10-26\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/areyourwageskeepingupwithinflation/2017-06-20\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/howinflationchangeshowmuchyourwagesareworth/2017-06-26\n  [15]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n  [16]: mailto:earnings@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1. ONS has published comparative estimates based on two different statistical models. Those quoted here are based on a model that controls for variables like region, occupation, age, gender and job tenure. The alternative model – which produces lower relative pay estimates for the public sector - also incorporates organisation size. ONS is developing this way of looking at differences between earnings; similar analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown slightly different results.\n2. Figures are for full- and part-time employees combined.\n3. Difference between average public and private sector pay is based on pay for each April. Difference after accounting for worker characteristics is adjusted to include bonus received throughout the year. The difference between public and private sector pay is based on 2016 revised Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) data, while the difference accounting for worker characteristics is based on 2016 provisional ASHE data."

These people were more concentrated in the most deprived areas than the least deprived areas.\n\nAround one in six (16.0%) lived in the 10% most deprived neighbourhoods, compared with just 1 in 20 (5.2%) in the least deprived neighbourhoods.\n\nIt’s therefore no coincidence that many of the local authorities with the highest proportions of smokers in 2016 ranked among the most deprived in England.\n\nMore than one-quarter of people (25.7%) in Hastings smoked, the highest percentage in England, compared with a nationwide average of 15.5%.\n\nBlackpool, Bradford and Hull in the North of England also ranked near the top for both smoking and deprivation.\n\nIn particular, Manchester and surrounding areas were home to a high percentage of smokers. As well as Manchester itself, at least one in five people smoked in Rossendale, Tameside, Knowsley and Salford.\n\nAt the opposite end of the smoking scale, just 4.9% of people smoked in Epsom and Ewell in Surrey (the lowest in England). Fewer than 1 in 10 people smoked in many of England’s least deprived areas, including places like Wokingham in Berkshire, Chiltern in Buckinghamshire and Waverley in Surrey.\n\n####Explore smoking prevalence by local authority in England in 2012 to 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc483/map/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Explore smoking prevalence by local authority in England in 2012 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][5]\n\n###Smoking contributes to health inequality\n\nAs smoking is more widespread in deprived areas, it’s not surprising that [associated diseases like lung cancer and respiratory disease are more common too][6].\n\nIn 85% of [cases where a patient has lung cancer][7], smoking is the biggest risk factor. Both men and women in England’s most deprived areas are roughly twice as likely to die from lung cancer compared with those in the least deprived areas.\n\nSimilarly, the NHS estimates that [smoking is responsible for 9 out of 10 cases of a type of respiratory disease called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)][8]. Deaths from respiratory diseases, including COPD, are more than twice as common in the most deprived places in England as the least deprived places.\n\n###But is it a declining habit?\n\nBetween 2012 and 2016, smoking declined at every level of area deprivation.\n\nIn 2016, 27.2% of adults living in England’s most deprived areas were smokers, down from close to one-third (32.7%) in 2012.\n\nMeanwhile, just 7.9% of adults in the least deprived neighbourhoods smoked in 2016, compared with 10.0% in 2012.\n\n####Smoking prevalence by deprivation decile, England, 2012 and 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc483/chart2/TieFighter/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Smoking prevalence by deprivation decile, England, 2012 and 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][9]\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">\n**The data and analysis in this article refer to England only.**\n\nThe ONS produces estimates for smoking prevalence across the UK using its Annual Population Survey (APS). However, devolved countries use statistics from their respective health surveys in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to track progress against tobacco control targets.\n\nMeanwhile, deprivation statistics are not comparable between England and the other devolved countries of the UK. Separate datasets are produced by the Welsh Government, Scottish Government and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA).\n</ons-box>\n\n###Finding help\n\nIf you want to quit smoking, there are lots of resources available to help:\n\n- find [Stop Smoking services near you][10] \n- find out more about [e-cigarettes][11] and [stop-smoking medicines][12]\n- join in the conversation on [social media][13]\n- get [email support][14]\n- download a [free app][15] to track your progress and get support \n\n###Footnotes\n\n1. The analysis looked at the odds of smoking across several self-reported domains of inequality (including local area deprivation, education, disability and sexual identity) using data from the 2016 Annual Population Survey. For simplicity, we refer to the odds of smoking as the “likelihood of smoking”. An odds ratio (OR) is a measure of association between an exposure (for example, demographics such as age, sex, poor health, different housing tenure types) and an outcome (for example, whether someone smokes). The OR represents the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure, compared with the odds of the outcome occurring in the absence of that exposure. More information about odds ratios and some example calculations can be found [here][17].\n\n2. Deprivation is an overall measure based on factors such as income, employment, health and education within an area. Deprivation in England is measured using the [Index of Multiple Deprivation 2015 (IMD15)][18]. In this article, we split areas into deprivation deciles. Deciles are calculated by ranking the 32,844 neighbourhoods (lower layer super output areas (LSOAs)) in England from most deprived to least deprived and dividing them into 10 equal groups. These range from the most deprived 10% of neighbourhoods nationally to the least deprived 10%.\n\n3. For each odds ratio calculation, there is a comparison group, referred to here as the “base category”. In our analysis the comparison group is that with largest sample size, and are as follows:\n- Area deprivation – someone living in the 10% least deprived areas\n- Housing tenure – someone who is not renting\n- Occupational group – someone doing a managerial or professional job\n- Marital status – someone who is married\n- Disability status – someone whose activity is not limited at all\n- Qualifications – someone with qualifications\n- Sexual identity – someone who is heterosexual/straight\n- Benefits status – someone not receiving benefits\n- Gender – a female\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/drugusealcoholandsmoking/adhocs/008181smokinginequalitiesinengland2016\n  [2]: https://www.nhs.uk/smokefree\n  [3]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/630217/Towards_a_Smoke_free_Generation_-_A_Tobacco_Control_Plan_for_England_2017-2022__2_.pdf\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc483datadownloads/oddsratios.csv\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc483datadownloads/map.csv\n  [6]: https://visual.ons.gov.uk/deprivation-by-leading-cause-of-death/\n  [7]: https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cancer-of-the-lung/Pages/Causes.aspx\n  [8]: https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/Pages/Causes.aspx\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc483datadownloads/deciles.csv\n  [10]: https://www.nhs.uk/smokefree/help-and-advice/local-support-services-helplines\n  [11]: https://www.nhs.uk/smokefree/help-and-advice/e-cigarettes\n  [12]: https://www.nhs.uk/smokefree/help-and-advice/prescription-medicines\n  [13]: https://www.facebook.com/NHSSmokefree/\n  [14]: https://quitnow.smokefree.nhs.uk/\n  [15]: https://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Pages/smokefree.aspx\n  [16]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n  [17]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2938757/\n  [18]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015"

China and the US are large economies and important UK trading partners, even accounting for their distance from us.\n\nHowever, distance is important. The value of the UK’s trading relationship with Ireland is higher than the value of UK trade with Italy or Spain, even though the total size of Ireland’s economy is much smaller than Italy’s or Spain’s.\n\n###How does geography impact UK exports and imports  to the rest of the world?\n\n#####UK Exports by distance from UK, 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc390/distance/export/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Trade - Scatter imports distance\"/>\n\n[Download the data][8]\n\n#####UK Imports by distance from UK, 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc390/distance/import/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Trade - Scatter imports distance\"/>\n\n[Download the data][9]\n\nThe UK runs a trade deficit (we import more than we export) with the biggest economies of the European Union.\n\nThe UK has a trade surplus (we export more than we import) with 67 territories, including Ireland, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Brazil.\n\n#####UK trade deficit and surplus by country, 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc390/in-out/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Trade - scatter import/export\"/>\n\n[Download the data][10]\n\n#####Notes: \n1. The downloadable data relating to this figure, UK trade deficit and surplus by country, 2016 was incorrectly linked to the previous figure. This has now been corrected, the figure and everything else in this release has not been affected.\n\nThe largest trade deficit is with Germany. In 2016 the UK imported £75 billion in goods and services from Germany, and sold £49 billion.\n\nAlthough the UK has a trade deficit with Germany, France and the Netherlands^3^, they are the second, third and fourth most important destinations for UK exports.\n\n###\"Special relationship\" with the US\n\nThe US is the country from which the UK earns the most through trade. Exports to the US in 2016 were worth £100 billion, more than twice as much as exports to any other country.\n\nWith imports from the US totalling £66 billion, the UK ran a trade surplus with the US of £34 billion in 2016 (by far the highest globally)^4^.\n\nWhile the value of UK exports to the EU has fallen between 2011 and 2016 (from £243 billion to £236 billion), the UK is increasingly exporting to the US. Exports to the US rose by more than 26% over the same period.\n\nThat being said, as a union of 27 other countries, the EU still had a much greater share of UK exports than the US in 2016 (43% compared with 18%). A report in the [FT][11] showed how for almost every category of goods exported, the EU was by far a bigger market than the US.\n\n###Our trade relationship with the US has strengthened in recent years\n\n#####UK trade with the US and rest of the world, imports and exports, 1999 to 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc390/worldmap/index.html#sty=false&flow=flow1&period=16&fix=UK&fix2=US&view=0,-40,800,635\" full-width=\"false\"/>\n\n[Download the data][12]\n\n###Sign up for email alerts\n\nIf you like our Visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up to our email alerts][13], selecting ‘stories and infographics’ under preferences.\n\n###Footnotes\n\n1. Croatia joined the EU in 2013. In 2000 and 2001 data are for non-UK EU26 and from 2002 onwards data are for non-UK EU 27\n\n2. Gold is an erratic commodity, so trade in gold is often highly volatile. We’re currently looking at ways to publish additional trade statistics that exclude non-monetary gold.\n\n3. The Rotterdam effect: It has been argued that the pattern of trade between the UK and other countries has been distorted by the location of big international ports such as Rotterdam. The Rotterdam effect is the situation where goods which are initially exported to one country are then re-exported somewhere else. An ONS article estimated that 50 per cent of all goods exported to the Netherlands were re-exported to non-EU countries. It also estimated that the Rotterdam effect would account for around four percentage points of the UK’s exports of goods. These effects were calculated to illustrate the possible size of the Rotterdam effect and does not imply that a different data series should be produced or used.\n\n4. In their official statistics, the US reports a trade surplus with the UK. Countries reporting different trade balances with each other is a well known international phenomenon, which affects all countries. There are multiple reasons such as measurement differences, conceptual differences and different data sources. We have conducted some analysis of the UK’s trade asymmetries, engaged in bilateral meetings with other National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) to understand some of the potential reasons for differences and we are working with an academic to develop possible models that might lead to improvements. This will be an area of ongoing focus within our development plan\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/preparing-for-our-future-uk-trade-policy\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc390/Imports-exports-1999-2016.xlsx\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/datasets/publicationtablesuktrade\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/articles/nationalaccountsarticles/abriefexplanationofnonmonetarygoldinnationalaccounts\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc390/Importstree.xlsx\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc390/Exportstree.xlsx\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/datasets/publicationtablesuktradecpa08/current\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc390/Distance-exports.xlsx\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc390/Distance-imports.xlsx\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc390/Import-export.xlsx\n  [11]: https://www.ft.com/content/37aa67a0-e94e-11e6-893c-082c54a7f539\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc390/Imports-exports-1999-2016.xlsx\n  [13]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new"

People may be using mobile phones to socialise when they’re watching television, but it’s not necessarily face-to-face communication.\n\nIt’s possible that with increased device use, people are becoming less likely to go out of their way to meet up and socialise.

Published 1 December 2018<br>\n\nTime of correction: 4pm 18 May 2018<br>\n\nA correction has been made to the Cohort life expectancy at birth chart in this article. This was due to the labels for males and females being transposed in the underlying data. We apologise for any inconvenience.\n\n###What is my life expectancy? And how might it change?\n\nA man aged 65 years in the UK can now expect to live, on average, to 85.6 and a woman of the same age to 87.8, new figures reveal. A boy born today could expect to live to 89.5, whilst a girl could expect to live to 92.1.\n\nUse our calculator to find out your life expectancy, your chance of living to 100 and how long you’re likely to need to make your pension pot last.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc221/index.html\" full-width=\"false\"/>\n\nWere you surprised? You’re not the only one! Anecdotal evidence suggests that we typically under-estimate our life expectancy.\n\nImproved working conditions, reduced smoking rates and improved healthcare have all contributed to increasing life expectancy from generation to generation.\n\n###We don’t know whether life expectancy will rise\n\nWhile we are now living longer than ever, in recent years these improvements in life expectancy in the UK have slowed down.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century life expectancy had improved rapidly, largely driven by reducing infant mortality rates and deaths from infectious diseases. Towards the end of the 20th Century there was also a steep decline in mortality rates at the oldest ages.\n<ons-chart path=\"45b9e7e7\" />\n\n[Download the data][2]\n\nInfant and child mortality rates are now at such low levels that it’s unlikely that further reductions will affect future life expectancy. Additionally, it is possible that other factors like medical advances, which have historically driven life expectancy improvements, may also stop having so much of an effect.\n\nThere is a debate as to whether the recent slowing down in life expectancy improvements is the start of a new trend, or whether it is just a blip in a trend of continuous improvement.\n\nIt is possible that obesity levels continue to rise and new diseases emerge, which could reduce future improvements in mortality. Anti-microbial resistance could increase and this may also play a part in slowing down life expectancy improvements.\n\nConversely, it is also possible that there will be lower incidences of cancer, heart disease and strokes through behavioural and lifestyle changes as well as new technology. Biomedical advancements in the future may also allow for better treatment of these common diseases, reducing their mortality rates.\n\nWe don’t know what life expectancy will look like in the future. But we can use historical mortality data and demographic expertise to make assumptions about future mortality, which are used to generate future life expectancy projections.\n\n\n###Notes:\n\n1. Life Expectancy\n\nLife expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time someone is expected to live. This tool calculates cohort life expectancy for men and women based on their sex and current age. Life expectancy is calculated using projected mortality rates for the UK from the 2016-based population projections developed by the Office for National Statistics.\n\n2. State Pension Age\n\nYour state pension age depends on your particular date of birth. This tool assumes your age as at 1st June of the year you were born to estimate your State Pension Age and the year you reach that age.

When net migration is above zero, as it has been continually since 1994, migration is adding to the UK population.\n\nNet migration is 106,000 lower than it was the year before: this is the largest fall in any 12-month period since records began in 1964 and represents a reduction of around a third. But it’s important to note that this fall was from a very high net migration figure of 336,000 in the year to June 2016.\n\nNet migration had been increasing since 2012; the recent fall sees net migration returning to the level we saw in 2014. This level of net migration is not unusual as we have seen net migration vary between 140,000 and 336,000 over the last 20 years.\n\n####UK net migration, years ending December 2007 to June 2017\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc466/netm/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK net migration, years ending December 2007 to June 2017\"/>\n\n[Download the data][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/11/netmigration.csv"

In Northern Ireland, women earn 3.4% more per hour, on average, than their male counterparts, the only region in the UK where the pay gap has been in favour of women, and this has been the case since 2010.\n\nThe gap in Wales and Scotland has narrowed over the last two decades, and now women earn 6.3% and 6.6% per hour less than men, respectively. In 1997, women earned 17.5% less than men in Wales, and 18.4% less in Scotland.\n\nAmong part-time workers, the picture is a little different regionally. The gender pay gap has reversed in some places, with women now earning more, on average, than men across all regions. The pay differences are largest in Northern Ireland, London and Wales.\n\nThe gap in the North East was particularly large in 1997 with part-time women earning 7.2% less per hour, on average than men, and now women earn 3.6% more than men.\n\nThe region with the smallest gender pay gap is the South East, where women earn just 3.1% more per hour, on average, than men.

      "markdown": "The post-World War 2 baby boom generation turned 70 in 2016. They were the first to benefit from 20th century developments such as ‘cradle to grave welfare’.\n\nThey have lived through a period of unprecedented economic, social, cultural and technological change.\n\nBabies born earlier, [during the baby boom that followed World War 1][1] lived through the [Great Depression][2], were young adults during World War 2, and turned 70 in the early 1990s, just as [recession][3] hit the UK.\n\nDespite there being fewer than three decades between these generations, there are differences in life expectancy, marital status, childbearing, and employment.\n\n###Survival to age 70 has improved\nThe number of people in their 70s in the UK increased from 4 million to 5 million between 1990 and 2016.\n\nThis is because survival was far better for the post-World War 2 baby boom generation (born 1946) than those born following the World War 1 baby-boom (born 1920).\n\nOnly 58% of the 957,782 babies born in England and Wales in 1920 (turning 70 in 1990) survived to age 70, compared to 78% of the 820,719 babies born in 1946 (turning 70 in 2016).\n\n####Survival to age 70, England and Wales\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc480/1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Survival to age 70, England and Wales\"/>\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc480/2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Donut chart\"/>\n\nWith increases in survival have come increases in life expectancy: life expectancy at birth for women in England and Wales pushed through the 70 age barrier in 1950, while men had to wait until 1977, almost three decades later.\n\n###Life expectancy at age 70 has improved\nHaving got there, today’s 70-year-olds also live for longer than their predecessors, particularly men.\n\nThe gap in life expectancy (the average years of life remaining) between men and women in the UK has narrowed, with life expectancy at age 70 increasing by 39% for men between 1990 and 2016, and by 21% for women.\n\nBased on mortality patterns in 2016, men aged 70 can now expect to live for a further 15.3 years, up from 11.0 years in 1990. For women this is 17.3 years, up from 14.3 years in 1990.\n\nIncreases in life expectancy have been linked to reductions in smoking and circulatory disease. People in their 70s in Great Britain are less likely to smoke than in the past. [The General Household Survey][4] reported that 18% were smokers in 1990 to 1991, dropping to 9% in 2016 ([Opinions and Lifestyle Survey][5]).\n\n###Marriage is on the increase, but so is divorce\nIncreases in life expectancy between 1991 and 2016 mean that more men survived into their 70s. Only 30% of women in their 70s were widows in 2016, compared to 49% in 1991.\n\nThis may help explain the increase in the proportion of women who are married (from 40% to 55%), as well as a climb in the number of older people who are divorced; a three-fold increase to 9% of men and a four-fold increase to 12% of women.\n\n####Marital status among men aged 70 to 79, 1991 and 2016, England and Wales\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc480/men_marital/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Marital status among men aged 70 to 79, 1991 and 2016, England and Wales\"/>\n\n[Download the data][6]\n\n####Marital status among women aged 70 to 79, 1991 and 2016, England and Wales\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc480/women_marital/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Marital status among women aged 70 to 79, 1991 and 2016, England and Wales\"/>\n\n[Download the data][7]\n\n###Marriage rates are highest for divorcees\nMarriage rates were higher for men aged 70 to 79 than their female counterparts, possibly because men tend to marry younger women. And marriage rates were higher for divorcees than single or widowed people.\n\n####Marriage rates among people aged 70 to 79 by previous marital status, 2015, England and Wales\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc480/marriages/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Marriage rates among people aged 70 to 79 by previous marital status, 2015, England and Wales\"/>\n\n[Download the data][8]\n\nHigh remarriage rates among divorcees could go some way to explain the concurrent increase in the proportion of both married and divorced people in their 70s since 1991, because while there has been an increase in the number of divorcees, divorced people are likely to remarry.\n\n###Fewer women are childless at age 70 today\nToday’s 70-year-old women are far less likely to be childless than the previous generation; childlessness halved from 21% to 9% of women between 1990 and 2015.\n\nHigher levels of childlessness among women turning 70 in 1990 could be associated with the harsh times that they lived through.\n\nThey experienced the shortages of the [Great Depression][9] in childhood and hit fertility during the turmoil of World War 2 during which many young men died, resulting in a deficit of potential husbands.\n\nFor people born in 1920, prior to World War 2 there were more men than women (1019 men to every 1,000 women aged 15 to 19 in 1936) in England and Wales, while after World War 2 there were more women than men (989 men to every 1000 women aged 25 to 29 in 1946).\n\nAs a result, today’s 70-year-old women are more likely to have children to support them in old age than a generation earlier.\n\nWhile fewer women are childless at age 70, they are less likely to have large families (four or more children) than in the past, and more likely to have just two or three children.\n\n####Number of children to women aged 70, 1991 and 2016, England and Wales\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc480/children/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Number of children to women aged 70, 1991 and 2016, England and Wales\"/>\n\n[Download the data][10]\n\n###Employment among older people is on the rise\nThe employment rate for people aged 70 to 79 in Great Britain doubled between 1992 and 2017, from 4% to 8%, according to the [Labour Force Survey][11].\n\nThe increase may have been partly due to [legislation][12] coming into force in 2011, which prevented employers from compulsorily retiring workers once they reach 65.\n\nMore people in their 70s are working than in the past. This could suggest that older people are healthier and more able to continue working into later life, after pensionable age. For some it could be due to a desire to work and stay active, but for others because of a need to work due to insufficient pension income.\n\n###People in their 70s are better off than previously\nRegardless of the reasons for increased employment, people in their 70s are more financially secure than in the past. In the [British Household Panel Survey][13] of 1991 only half of people (52%) reported their financial situation as either ‘doing alright’ or ‘living comfortably’. By 2016 this had increased to 82% ([Understanding Society][14]).\n\nThis change may be related to the recession in the early 1990s, which would have dampened financial optimism.\n\n####Current financial situation, ages 70 to 79, 1991 and 2016, UK\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc480/finance/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Current financial situation, ages 70 to 79, 1991 and 2016, UK\"/>\n\n[Download the data][15]\n\nAnother explanation for the increase in financial confidence is an increase in home ownership.\n\nAccording to the [General Household Survey][16], in Great Britain in 1990 to 1991 only half (52%) of people in their 70s lived in homes that were owned outright, compared to three-quarters (78%) in 2016 ([Opinions and Lifestyle Survey][17]).\n\nPeople turning 70 today were in their mid-30s when then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expanded the [Right to Buy scheme][18] in 1980, a scheme which was open to a large swathe of the population: [in 1979 around 32% of all dwellings in Britain were council houses][19].\n\nThey benefitted from large discounts on council houses, resulting in a rapid expansion in home ownership; sales peaked in 1982 to 1983 with 182,171 homes sold over 12 months in England and Wales. People turning 70 in 1990 were in their early 60s at that time and would have found it more difficult to secure a mortgage.\n\nAnother factor in increased financial confidence of those in their 70s in 2016 may be an improvement in educational levels driving better-paid, more secure jobs than in the past. The 1991 to 1992 [Health Survey for England][20] found that most people (71%) in their 70s had no qualifications and only 10% had an A-level or higher. By 2015 less than half (47%) had no qualifications, and the proportion educated to at least A-level had trebled to 31%.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/10339662/First-World-War-still-shaping-Britain-as-original-baby-boomers-trigger-surge-in-over-90s.html\n  [2]: http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item107595.html\n  [3]: https://www.theguardian.com/business/gallery/2009/jan/22/recession-margaretthatcher\n  [4]: https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/series/?sn=200019\n  [5]: https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/series/?sn=2000043\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc480/men_marital/Marital-status.csv\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc480/women_marital/Marital-status.csv\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc480/marriages/Marriage-rates.csv\n  [9]: http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item107595.html\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc480/children/Completed-family-size.csv\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/surveys/informationforhouseholdsandindividuals/householdandindividualsurveys/labourforcesurveylfs\n  [12]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15127835\n  [13]: https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/bhps\n  [14]: https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/\n  [15]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc480/finance/Financial-situation.csv\n  [16]: https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/series/?sn=200019\n  [17]: https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/series/?sn=2000043\n  [18]: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/26/right-to-buy-margaret-thatcher-david-cameron-housing-crisis\n  [19]: https://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/wps/WP201505.pdf\n  [20]: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/hssrg/studies/hse"

      "markdown": "Mums and dads working full-time on the new National Living Wage will earn £212 per week less than the average amount spent by households with two adults and two children in the financial year ending 2017, according to ONS data.\n\nTwo parents aged 25 and over who each work 37.5 hours per week at the new National Living Wage rate of £7.83 per hour will take home a total of £529 per week after Income Tax and National Insurance.\n\nMeanwhile [ONS spending data][1] show that in the financial year ending 2017 a household with two adults and two children, where one or both parents may work less than 37.5 hours per week, [spent an average of £741 per week][2] on housing, bills, food, clothes, childcare, holidays and other living costs.\n\n###One-earner households\n\nThe gap between earnings and average household spending varies depending on household circumstances, including how many people live in a household.\n\nSomeone aged 25 and over who works 37.5 hours per week on the new NLW will earn £265 per week after Income Tax and National Insurance.\n\nIn the financial year ending 2017, households containing only one non-retired adult with no children spent an average of £347 per week. Households with one adult and one child spent an average of £336 per week, and those with one adult and two or more children spent an average of £421 per week.\n\n###Comparing earnings and spending\n\nThese figures compare 2018 National Living Wage earnings to household spending levels in the financial year ending 2017. Since 2017, household spending levels are likely to have risen because of price rises (the most recent measure of inflation, Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH), stood at [2.5% in February 2018][3]).\n\nIt’s important to note that earnings are not the only source of income. Tax credits, benefits and investments may help low-earners bring in more money. And low-income households [tend to spend less][4] than high-income ones, so in many households the gap between earnings and spending may be a lot smaller, or non-existent. However people in the UK are borrowing more than they used to, and [levels of household debt have gone up][5] in recent years.\n\n###Could you live on the National Living Wage?\n\nOur calculator allows you to see how affordable your lifestyle would be if you earned the National Living Wage. We’ve also helped you see how your spending compares to the UK average household, using the latest ONS [family spending data][6].\n\nOur calculator has allowed for deductions of Income Tax or Scottish Income Tax, depending on where you live, as well as class 1 National Insurance at category A or M rates, depending on your age.\n\nBut our calculator does not take account of pension contributions, nor allow for any [benefits][7] or [tax credits][8] you may be entitled to, which are dependent on your personal circumstances.\n\n<div style=\"height:3px; width:100%; background-color:rgb(59,122,158); margin-bottom:20px;\"></div>\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc486/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"National Living Wage\"/>\n\n###National Living Wage going up\n\nOn 1 April 2018, the [National Living Wage][9] (NLW) will go up from £7.50 per hour to £7.83 per hour. The NLW is the legal minimum hourly rate most people in the UK aged 25 or more can be paid.\n\nThis means someone who earns the National Living Wage and works 37.5 hours per week – the [median number of hours worked by full-time workers in the UK in 2017][10] – will earn the following before tax:\n\n- £294 per week\n- £1,272 per month\n- £15,269 per year\n\nThese figures include holiday pay, which some workers (including those on \"zero-hours\" contracts) may not receive.\n\nFor workers aged 25 and over, the National Living Wage has replaced the National Minimum Wage (NMW). The government introduced the NMW in 1999 for workers aged 22 and over, and extended it to 21-year-olds in 2010.\n\nIn 2016, when the National Living Wage was introduced, the National Minimum Wage remained in place for workers above the school leaving age but under 25.\n\n###National Minimum Wage, National Living Wage and average earnings\n\nOver the years the National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage have become relatively more generous compared to average earnings.\n\nIn 1999, the National Minimum Wage was £3.60 per hour. This was 46% of median hourly pay for workers aged 22 and over. By 2017, its successor the National Living Wage had reached 58% of median hourly pay for the age group it applied to.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"ba6821e7\" />\n\nThis means that between 1 January and 31 July, someone aged 25 or over earning the average salary will have already earned the equivalent of a National Living Wage earner’s salary for the whole year.\n\n###What is a “living wage”?\n\nThe government introduced the National Living Wage in 2016, and it wants the NLW to reach 60% of average earnings by 2020, provided the UK economy continues to grow.\n\nHowever the idea of a “living wage” [has existed since the 1870s][11] – and for almost all of that time the concept has not been related to the earnings of others, but instead has meant a wage that is enough to provide an acceptable standard of living.\n\nSince 2001, beginning in London, the [Living Wage Foundation][12] has campaigned for a wage that supports the [Minimum Income Standard][13], a standard that is based on the [opinions of members of the public][14], as well as advice from experts like nutritionists and heating engineers.\n\nIt takes account of different household types – single people, families with children, pensioners – and includes:\n\n- food\n- clothes\n- accommodation\n- utilities\n- fuel\n- household goods\n- personal goods and services\n- transport\n- social and cultural activities\n\nUnlike the government’s National Living Wage, the Living Wage Foundation’s UK living wage (which the foundation calls the \"real\" living wage) is based on being able to afford this basic set of goods and services. It also takes account of the higher cost of living in London, so is higher in the UK capital. Businesses can choose whether or not to pay the UK or London living wage, and [around 4,000 employers currently do so][15].\n\nBetween 2011 and 2017, the UK living wage was set  between 17% and 23% higher than the National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage. Over the same period the London living wage was between 35% and 41% higher than the statutory rates. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"68d36f8e\" />\n\n###Real wages\n\nThe upward-sloping graph above shows rates of pay in nominal terms, which doesn’t reflect how pay compares to prices.\n\nWhen we look at average earnings in real terms, since the 2008 recession, people’s take-home pay has often [failed to keep up with inflation][16], meaning that they feel poorer each month. This is one of the reasons wages have remained high on the agenda in public debate.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/bulletins/familyspendingintheuk/financialyearending2017\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/expenditurebyhouseholdcompositionuktablea23\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/february2018\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/datasets/householdexpenditurebydisposableincomedecilegroupuktablea7\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/wealthingreatbritainwave5/2014to2016#household-debt\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/bulletins/familyspendingintheuk/financialyearending2017\n  [7]: https://www.gov.uk/benefits-calculators\n  [8]: https://www.gov.uk/tax-credits-calculator\n  [9]: https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/allemployeesashetable1\n  [11]: http://web.archive.org/web/20150210150211/http:/www.geog.qmul.ac.uk/livingwage/history.html\n  [12]: https://www.livingwage.org.uk/\n  [13]: http://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/crsp/mis/\n  [14]: https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/minimum-income-standard-britain-what-people-think\n  [15]: https://www.livingwage.org.uk/accredited-living-wage-employers\n  [16]: https://visual.ons.gov.uk/are-your-wages-keeping-up-with-inflation/"

([Lancashire Council website][7])\n\n###How heroin and morphine deaths have varied over time\nThere were 3,744 drug poisoning deaths (involving both legal and illegal drugs) registered in 2016 in England and Wales. Of those deaths, 2,593 were from drug misuse, which represents 69% of total deaths. In 1993 the proportion was 38%. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"1ff8c300\" />\n\n<ons-chart path=\"71438784\" />\n\nHeroin and/or morphine is the drug used by the so-called  “[Trainspotting generation][8]”. Death rates from the misuse of opiates have [steadily climbed][9] between 1993  (when data were first collected) and 1996; since then they have plateaued at around 80% of all opiate deaths, through to 2016.  \n\nThis “Trainspotting generation”, which became addicted to heroin in the 1980s and 1990s, has been cited as one of the reasons for the increase. This may also explain why the highest rate of death from drugs misuse in 2016 was among the 40 to 49-year-olds, overtaking those aged 30 to 39 years.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"1a29c600\" />\n\nIn 2016, the number of drug-related deaths where heroin and/or morphine were mentioned on the death certificate has increased by almost eight times since 1993. There has been only a slight increase from 2015, where 1,201 deaths were registered, but there has been an increase of almost two-thirds since 2012, following the “[heroin drought][10]” of 2010 to 2011. \n\n####Notes:\n1.

But in April to June 2008, it began to fall.\n\nThe economy kept getting smaller for five successive quarters.

By the end of 2011, almost 2.7 million people were looking for work. The quarterly unemployment rate reached 8.4%, the highest rate since 1995.\n\nUnemployment had returned to its pre-downturn rate at the end of 2015, and since then it has continued to fall – reaching a record low of 4.3% in the third quarter of 2017 before rising slightly at the end of the year.\n\n####Unemployment rate (aged 16 and over, seasonally adjusted), UK, Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2008 to Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2017\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc496/Recession/chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Unemployment rate (aged 16 and over, seasonally adjusted), UK, Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2008 to Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2017\"/>\n[Download the data][3]\n####Earnings haven't kept up with prices\n\nEarnings have lagged behind prices for most of the decade since the start of the recession.\n\nIn the public sector, a pay freeze (from 2011) and pay cap (from 2013) kept wage rises below inflation, while in the private sector wage growth was also slow.\n\nThere was a two-year period beginning around July 2014 when wages rose in real terms – this was due largely to the fall in the price of oil causing prices to come down too.\n\nHowever, between November 2015 and October 2016, the pound fell in value by 20%, including a record 6.5% fall between June and July 2016 following the EU referendum. This meant it was more expensive to import goods and services, so prices rose and earnings are again failing to keep up with prices.\n\n####Despite low unemployment, real earnings have barely risen\n#####Percentage changes in real earnings, year-on-year (three-month average), UK, January 2008 to December 2017\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc496/Recession/chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Despite low unemployment, real earnings have barely risen\"/>\n[Download the data][4]\n####The productivity puzzle\n\nOne way to measure the strength of the economy is looking at how much money each worker adds to the economy – their labour productivity, measured in output per hour.\n\nProductivity had been rising steadily before the recession, but it slumped in 2008 and has barely recovered since. Had the pre-2008 trend continued, productivity would have been 20% higher than it actually was at the end of 2017.\n\nLots of reasons have been suggested for this, including banks not being willing to lend to new businesses, low levels of business investment and companies being able to keep staff on instead of making them redundant, because wages have not been rising.\n\nBut the phenomenon of low productivity growth, common to many economies across Europe, is not fully understood and has been called the “productivity puzzle”.\n\n####Labour productivity: output per hour, seasonally adjusted, Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 1994 to Quarter 4 2017, UK\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc496/Recession/chart5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Labour productivity: output per hour, seasonally adjusted, Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 1994 to Quarter 4 2017, UK\"/>\n[Download the data][5]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc496/Recession/downloadthedata/chart1.csv\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc496/Recession/downloadthedata/chart2.csv\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc496/Recession/downloadthedata/chart3.csv\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc496/Recession/downloadthedata/chart4.csv\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc496/Recession/downloadthedata/chart5.csv"

      "markdown": "The proportion of employees who contribute to a workplace pension has increased by almost a quarter, around 73% of UK employees had an active workplace pension scheme in 2017, up from less than 47% in 2012, ONS data has shown.\n\nMuch of this rise is down to the introduction by the Government of automatic enrolment in October 2012. Since then [more than 9.5 million people have been automatically enrolled through the scheme.][1]\n<ons-box align=\"full\">\nAutomatic enrolment is a Government initiative to help more people save for later life through a pension scheme at work.\n\nIt makes it compulsory for employers to automatically enrol their eligible workers into a pension scheme. The employer must also pay money into the scheme.\n\n[Employees are eligible for automatic enrolment if they’re at least 22 years old (and not yet at State Pension age) and earning a salary of at least £10,000 per year][2].\n</ons-box>\n\nIn particular, automatic enrolment led to increased participation in workplace defined contribution pensions^1^. Around 43% of all UK employees paid into a defined contribution pension in 2017, compared with 17% in 2012.\n\nIn the past, many workers missed out on valuable pension benefits, because their employer didn’t offer them a pension, or they didn’t apply to join their company’s pension scheme [(Pensions Advisory Service).][3] Automatic enrolment changes this.\n\n####Proportion of employees with workplace pension, by type of pension, UK, 2007 to 2017 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc497/pensiontime/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of employees with workplace pension, by type of pension, UK, 2007 to 2017\"/>\n[Download the data][4]\n\n###Since the introduction of automatic enrolment, contributions to defined contribution schemes have clustered at minimum levels\n\nWhile there has been a sizeable increase in the number of people participating in workplace pensions, many in the private sector with defined contribution pension schemes were contributing at relatively low levels.\n\nLast month, the minimum overall contribution rate to an automatically enrolled pension rose from 2% to 5%, of an employee's qualifying earnings^2^, with the minimum contribution from the employer rising from 1% to 2%. An employer may opt to pay all the total minimum however if an employer only contributes their minimum rate, the employee must make up the difference; which is now 3% rather than 1%. Next April, the total contribution rate rises again to 8%, at least 3% of which must come from an employer.\n\nIn 2017, almost half of private sector employers with defined contribution schemes contributed less than 2% of pensionable earnings, compared with around 6% in 2012.\n\nIt’s not necessarily that employers had reduced their contributions since 2012, rather that automatic enrolment has led to an influx of new savers at low rates, changing the distribution of employer contribution rates.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"ade45bbf\" />\n\nSimilarly, employee contributions were concentrated at low levels in 2017. Around 45% of private sector employees with defined contribution pension schemes were contributing less than 1% of pensionable earnings, and only around one in three employees were contributing 3% or more.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"85589187\" />\n\n\n###Automatic enrolment has pulled in the young and low-paid\n\nAuto-enrolment has led to huge gains in pension participation in groups like the young and low paid, who often weren’t provided with pension schemes.\n\nNearly 63% of private sector workers aged 22 to 29 paid into a defined contribution pension in 2017, up from just 16% in 2012. \n\n####Proportion of private sector workers with defined contribution pension, by age band, UK, 2007 to 2017\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc497/DCage2017/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of private sector workers with defined contribution pension, by age band, UK, 2007 to 2017\"/>\n[Download the data][5]\n\n\n[Among those in the lowest paid occupation groups][6] – caring and leisure, sales and customer service, and elementary occupations – the proportion of private sector workers paying into defined contribution schemes was close to half in 2017. Five years earlier, the majority of workers in these jobs had no active workplace pension.\n\n####Proportion of private sector workers with defined contribution pension, by occupation, UK, 2007 to 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc497/DCSOC2017/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of private sector workers with defined contribution pension, by occupation, UK, 2007 to 2017\"/>\n[Download the data][7]\n\nBecause of its phased introduction, automatic enrolment has led to a sustained rise in pension participation between 2012 and 2017. When auto-enrolment was first rolled out in October 2012, it was only larger companies who were required to enrol their employees by the end of the [staging date][8]. \n\n####Proportion of private sector workers with defined contribution pension, by size of employer, UK, 2007 to 2017\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc497/employersize/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of private sector workers with defined contribution pension, by size of employer, UK, 2007 to 2017\"/>\n[Download the data][9]\n\n###Will higher contributions lead employees to stop saving?\n\nSo far, around 9 in 10 employees have remained in their workplace pension after being enrolled. \n\nBut employees with an auto-enrolment pension can choose to stop saving at any time, although they’ll lose out on future private pension benefits including contributions from their employer as well as associated tax relief from their own contributions.\n\nWith the new higher minimum contributions in force last month, [some workers may have already seen an impact on their take-home pay.][10]\n\nUse our calculator to find out your life expectancy, your chance of living to 100 and how long you’re likely to need to make your pension pot last.\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc221/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"How long will your pension pot need to last?\"/>\n\n#####Note:\n 1. A defined contribution pension builds up a pension pot using your contributions and your employer’s contributions (if applicable) plus investment returns. Defined contribution pensions are concentrated in the private sector. A defined benefit pension is based on your salary and how long you’ve worked for your employer (it’s sometimes called a “final salary” pension). Most public sector pensions (94%) are defined benefit.\n\n2. The earnings used to calculate the contribution rates presented in this article are not based on ‘qualifying earnings’ but pensionable earnings as stated by the employer and excludes employees whose pay was affected by absence. This is not necessarily the same as “qualifying earnings” defined by the [auto-enrolment policy][11]. Employers may contribute on a wider band of earnings than defined by the auto-enrolment policy.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/docs/automatic-enrolment-declaration-of-compliance-monthly-report.pdf\n  [2]: https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions/what-you-your-employer-and-the-government-pay\n  [3]: https://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk/about-pensions/pensions-basics/automatic-enrolment\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc497/data/pension.csv\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc497/data/age.csv\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2017provisionaland2016revisedresults#earnings-by-occupation\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc497/data/soc.csv\n  [8]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-timetable-clarifies-automatic-enrolment-starting-dates\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc497/data/size.csv\n  [10]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43654409\n  [11]: https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions/what-you-your-employer-and-the-government-pay"

The Great Get Together aims to encourage people to spend time together to celebrate that “we are far more united and have far more in common than that which divides us”, as Ms Cox said in her [maiden speech][2] in the House of Commons.\n\n###How much time do we spend with other people and how much on our own? \nWhile people in the UK spend most of our leisure time with others, we spend 29% of it – an average of 100 minutes per day – on our own, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis.\n\nThose aged 65 and over spend the most leisure time on their own – 2 hours and 39 minutes a day – but they’re more than twice as likely to chat to their neighbours as those aged 16 to 24.\n\n[Leisure time][3] is the time when people are not working (including unpaid work like housework and caring for family members), studying, commuting or doing basic activities for existence like sleeping and eating at home.\n\n###Men have most leisure time alone\n\nMen have almost 40 minutes per day [more leisure time than women][4] on average – a total of 6 hours and 9 minutes per day – and they spend 1 hour and 50 minutes of it on their own. Both sexes spend a similar proportion of their leisure time by themselves (30% for men and 27% for women).\n\n####Leisure time spent alone and with others per day, by sex; UK, 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc505/chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Leisure time spent alone and with others per day, by sex; UK, 2015\"/>\n[Download the data][5]\n\n###Young adults and older people spend most leisure time alone\n\nThe amount of leisure time people spend alone changes with age; 16 to 24-year-olds and those aged 55 and over spend the highest amount of time on their own.\n\nPeople aged 25 to 54 (who have the least leisure time available) and children spend the least time by themselves. People aged 65 and over spend an average of 37% of their leisure time – 2 hours and 39 minutes per day – on their own.\n\n####Leisure time spent alone and with others per day, by age group; UK, 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc505/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Leisure time spent alone and with others per day, by age group; UK, 2015\"/>\n[Download the data][6]\n\n###“I want to be alone”?\n\nWhat does this time by ourselves mean for our well-being? People who spend time alone are not necessarily lonely: loneliness [can be influenced by a range of personal circumstances][7].\n\nHowever, when considering the whole day (not just leisure time), people tend to enjoy the time they spend with others slightly more than time by themselves – although this too varies with age.\n\nChildren are the only age group who enjoy the time they spend alone significantly more than the time they spend with others. People’s enjoyment of both the time they spend alone and with others increases from the age of 55.\n\nThis might be because of the activities people are doing when they're alone. Older people are more likely to be working, commuting and doing household chores, while children and young adults may do more enjoyable things when they're by themselves. \n\n####Enjoyment of time alone and with others, by age group (on a scale from 0 to 7); UK, 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc505/chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Enjoyment of time alone and with others, by age group (on a scale from 0 to 7); UK, 2015\"/>\n[Download the data][8]\n\n###Most people get together at least every week\n\nWe see our family and friends pretty regularly – most people in England manage to see their loved ones at least once a week, especially those in the younger and older age groups. People aged in their late 30s and 40s are least likely to meet up, but even in this age group, 70% see their relatives and friends at least weekly.\n\n####Proportion of people who meet with family or friends at least once a week, by age group; England, 2016 to 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc505/chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of people who meet with family or friends at least once a week, by age group; England, 2016 to 2017\"/>\n[Download the data][9]\n\nChatting to our neighbours is less likely, and whether people do so varies much more with age. Those aged 65 and over are more than twice as likely to talk to neighbours as 16 to 24-year-olds.\n\n####Proportion of people who chat to their neighbours (more than just to say hello) at least once a week, by age group; England, 2016 to 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc505/chart5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of people who chat to their neighbours (more than just to say hello) at least once a week, by age group; England, 2016 to 2017\"/>\n[Download the data][10]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.greatgettogether.org/\n  [2]: https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2015-06-03/debates/15060324000002/DevolutionAndGrowthAcrossBritain#contribution-15060332000038\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/satelliteaccounts/articles/leisuretimeintheuk/2015\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/menenjoyfivehoursmoreleisuretimeperweekthanwomen/2018-01-09\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc505/chart1.csv\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc505/chart2.csv\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/lonelinesswhatcharacteristicsandcircumstancesareassociatedwithfeelinglonely/2018-04-10\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc505/chart3.csv\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc505/chart4.csv\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc505/chart5.csv"

      "markdown": "Productivity is a measure of the amount of output a business produces for a unit of input. In its simplest form, labour productivity measures the amount of output produced per worker: higher productivity means that a business produces more output for each worker it employs. \n\nProductivity is important because it is a key determinant of living standards in the long term. Growing productivity over time means businesses can produce more goods and services per unit of input (labour, capital and others), permitting higher wages, supporting economic growth, holding back inflation and increasing tax revenues, in turn making it easier for government to provide essential services. Its importance makes the UK’s relatively poor productivity performance since 2008 one of the UK’s biggest economic policy challenges, reflected in the prominence of productivity in the recently published white paper on the [Industrial Strategy][1]. \n\nTo help businesses better understand their productivity, and how they compare to other businesses, we have launched an interactive productivity benchmarking tool. This will let you  calculate the productivity of your own business over time; and   compare your productivity performance to other businesses in your industry. You only need three pieces of information: your turnover (or sales), your purchases of inputs (excluding investment), and how many people you employ. \n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy-building-a-britain-fit-for-the-future\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/articles/labourproductivitymeasuresfromtheannualbusinesssurvey/2006to2015\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/articles/understandingfirmsinthebottom10ofthelabourproductivitydistributioningreatbritain/jantomar2017\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/articles/foreigndirectinvestmentandlabourproductivityamicrodataperspective/2012to2015\n  [5]: http://%5C%5Cnsdata7%5CEconlab%5CProjects%5CProductivity%20Benchmarking%5C%E2%80%A2%09https:%5Cwww.ons.gov.uk%5Cemploymentandlabourmarket%5Cpeopleinwork%5Clabourproductivity%5Carticles%5Cexperimentaldataonthemanagementpracticesofmanufacturingbusinessesingreatbritain%5C2018-04-06\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk//economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/articles/uktradeingoodsandproductivitynewfindings/2018-07-06"

The importance of understanding why UK productivity growth has slowed so sharply means that ONS and others have spent a lot of time examining the drivers of productivity growth and characteristics of highly productive businesses. ONS research has identified a range of business characteristics that are correlated with higher levels of productivity including the impact of size, foreign direct investment (FDI), management practices and trade. Details can be found in the following articles:\n\n- [Labour productivity measures from the Annual Business Survey: 2006 to 2015][1]\n\n- [Understanding firms in the bottom 10% of the labour productivity distribution in Great Britain: “the laggards”, 2003 to 2015][2]\n\n- [Foreign direct investment (FDI) and labour productivity, a micro-data perspective: 2012 to 2015][3]\n\n- [Management practices and productivity in British production and services industries - initial results from the Management and Expectations Survey: 2016][4]\n\n- [UK trade in goods and productivity: New findings][5]\n \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/articles/labourproductivitymeasuresfromtheannualbusinesssurvey/2006to2015\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/articles/understandingfirmsinthebottom10ofthelabourproductivitydistributioningreatbritain/jantomar2017\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/articles/foreigndirectinvestmentandlabourproductivityamicrodataperspective/2012to2015\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/articles/experimentaldataonthemanagementpracticesofmanufacturingbusinessesingreatbritain/2018-04-06 \n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/articles/uktradeingoodsandproductivitynewfindings/2018-07-06"

      "markdown": "The Annual Business Survey (ABS) provides the financial data on turnover, intermediate purchases and “approximate gross value added” (aGVA) for calculating labour productivity in our analysis. The ABS is the main structural business survey conducted by the ONS. It surveys around 65,000 firms on an annual basis to collect information from firms in the production, construction, distribution and services industries, representing approximately two-thirds of the UK economy. The ABS data used for the benchmarking tool covers firms in Great Britain and therefore excludes Northern Ireland. The ABS has partial coverage of agricultural and financial services industries. For quality and confidentiality reasons, data for certain industries have been supressed.\n\nThe business-specific measure of labour input that we used in this analysis was employment – including both employees and working proprietors – and was obtained from the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) at the time of sample selection of the ABS. \n\nFinally, our measure of labour productivity (GVA per worker) was calculated as aGVA at basic prices over employment. To derive our estimates of labour productivity, we excluded firms at the top and bottom 1% of the ABS sample as an outlier adjustment. Businesses can have negative productivity in periods where their expenditure on goods and services exceeds their turnover (sales) for that period.\n\n"

If this were to continue, households could risk lacking enough collateral to cover their debts. \n\nWe’re borrowing more and saving less partly because the interest rate – which dictates returns on money saved and the size of loan repayments – has been at or near a record low for the past decade.\n\nThe base rate set by the Bank of England is just 0.5%, compared with almost 15% in 1990, making financial conditions better for borrowers rather than savers.\n\nRecently, the Bank of England has been [warning the country to expect interest rate rises][2]. Expectations of an interest rate rise can affect saving and borrowing behaviour. Borrowing could rise in the short-term as households seek to take advantage of smaller repayments, while saving could be put off amid the prospect of higher returns in future.\n\n\n  [1]: http://fullfact.org/health/spending-english-nhs/\n  [2]: http://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/07/bank-of-england-interest-rate-setter-hints-at-rise-in-august"

Those in temporary low-income spells could be more likely to borrow or use savings to maintain their spending levels. Meanwhile, others on low income may be receiving benefits. There’s evidence to suggest that certain types of benefits are under-reported in survey data, which could lead to income being underestimated at the bottom of the distribution.\n"

      "markdown": "The average number of sickness absence days that UK workers take has almost halved since records began in 1993, Office for National Statistics (ONS)  figures have revealed^1^. \n\nThe figures show that employees took an average of 4.1 sickness absence days in 2017, compared with 7.2 days in 1993, but sickness absence started to fall overall from 1999.\n\nThe proportion of working hours lost to sickness absence is known as the sickness absence rate. \n\nSince the economic downturn of 2008 sickness absence rates in the UK have fallen by 0.5 percentage points to 1.9% in 2017. Over the same period, in the private sector rates have decreased by 0.4 percentage points. In 2017, the rate stood at 1.7% for the private sector and 2.6% for the public sector. Public sector health workers had the highest rates at 3.3%.\n\nRates may have decreased as [healthy life expectancy has improved over time][1]. Rates in the private sector could be lower as workers are less likely to be paid for a spell of sickness. There may also be an increase in [presenteeism,][2] where people go to work even though they are ill. \n\n###Sickness absence overall decreasing \n<ons-chart path=\"666843b1\" />\n\n###How do you compare with other workers? Tell us about where you work to find out\nYour sickness absence rates can be affected  by whether you work in the private or public sector, the workforce size of your employer and the sort of industry you work in.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc502/calc/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Sickness absence calculator\"/>\n[Download the data.][3]\n\n###How employer type affects sickness absence rates \nThough the sickness absence rate for the public sector as a whole was 2.6% in 2017, workers in the public administration, education and health industry, which includes some private sector health and education workers, have the highest sickness absence rate across all industries. In 2017, this stood at 2.5%. It is possible that the exposure of health workers to infections and diseases contributes to their higher sickness absence rate. Also, this industry is still largely in the public sector, which has a higher sickness absence rate.\n\nSince 1994 (the earliest data available), the rate for workers in the public sector has been consistently higher than in the private sector, although both sectors have seen an overall decrease. \n\nHigher sickness absence in the public sector is [partly explained by][4] the profile of the workforce: it employs more older people and women, both of whom tend to have higher rates of sickness absence; it is more likely to employ staff with a long-standing health condition who are more likely to go off sick and tends to offer more generous sick pay arrangements.\n\nWorkers in large organisations employing 500 or more people report the highest rate of sickness absence across all business sizes. In 2017, this stood at 2.3% compared with a rate of 1.6% for workers in organisations that employ fewer than 25 people. It may be possible that individuals in smaller workforces are under more pressure to make up any lost hours.  \n\n###How age affects reasons for sickness absence\nMore than a quarter (26.2%) of days lost through sickness absence in 2017 were attributed to minor illness (such as coughs and colds). This adds up to 34.3 million days per year.\n\nWhile minor illness remained the predominant reason for sickness absence in each age group, there was a difference between ages when other reasons were examined.\n\nMusculoskeletal problems, such as back and joint pain, was a reason for sickness absence for 20.8% of 50-to 64-year-olds and 18.7% of 35-to 49-year-olds. \n\nThere has been an increase in the proportion of younger workers aged 25 to 34, who attribute their sickness absence to mental health conditions, rising from 7.2% in 2009 to 9.6% in 2017, an increase of 2.4 percentage points.\n\n####Reasons for sickness absence: by age, UK, 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc502/slope_age/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Reasons for sickness absence: by age, UK, 2017\"/>\n[Download the data.][5]\n\nThere is also a divide between the sexes in sickness absence, with women more prone to minor illnesses (38.5% compared with 32.7%) and men tending to experience more sickness absence due to musculoskeletal conditions (28% compared with 18.4%).\n\nWomen were also more likely than men to cite mental health conditions as reasons for sickness absence-- 8.1% of women compared with 5.7% of men. Sickness absence for mental health reasons could be higher for women because [men are less likely to seek medical help for mental health problems than women][6] and also because medical professionals are [more likely to diagnose women][7] with mental health conditions than men. \n\n####Reasons for sickness absence: by sex, UK, 2017\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc502/slope_sex/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Reasons for sickness absence: by sex, UK, 2017\"/>\n[Download the data.][8]\n\n##How health status affects sickness absence reasons\nWorkers with long-term health conditions experienced a higher rate of sickness absence, at 3.9% compared with 1.2% for those without. \n\nWorkers with disabilities experienced the highest sickness absence rate across all workers, at 6.7% compared with 1.2% for those without, albeit down from 8.1% in 2014. \n\n##Footnotes: \n1. Sickness absence rates are used by government and businesses to measure employee health and to prevent loss of work. The costs associated with sickness absence can impact productivity of the economy.\n\n2. The sickness absence rate is the percentage of total expected working hours lost due to sickness.\n\n3. These factors were determined by a logistic regression model, detailed in Table 19 of the data download. \n\n4.

This was caused by a few minor problems in the original data, due to a mistaken chemical conversion. We apologise for any inconvenience.\n</ons-box>\n\n\n\nOverall, an estimated 1.3 billion kg of air pollutants were removed by woodlands, plants, grasslands and other UK vegetation in 2015^1^, according to a [study][1] produced for the [UK Natural Capital][2] accounts by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.\n\nTo put this in context, over five times as much PM~2.5~ was emitted in the UK in 2015, than was removed by vegetation in 2015^2^.\n\nThis pollution removal saved the UK around £1 billion in avoided health damage costs^3^. It is estimated there were 7,200 fewer lung and heart-related hospital admissions, 27,800 fewer life years lost and 1,900 fewer premature deaths in 2015 as result of nature providing this service.\n\nTrees in particular provide a wide range of services and account for most of the volume of air pollutants absorbed by natural vegetation in the UK but can have adverse effects also^4^.\n\nThe study looks at the role of vegetation in removing air pollutants, and the benefits they provide to human health through reductions in exposure. Most harmful is PM~2.5~ (fine particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres, or 3% of the diameter of a human hair), but the study also covers PM~10~, nitrogen dioxide, ground-level  ozone, ammonia and sulphur dioxide.\n\nEven though vegetation will not solve the whole issue of air quality in the UK, and in some cases vegetation can have adverse effects on air quality, the service of air pollution absorption by vegetation is nevertheless an important one.\n\n####Find out how much pollution is removed by vegetation in your area, and how this is valued in avoided health damage costs. \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc519/pollution/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Find out how much pollution is removed by vegetation in your area, and how this is valued in avoided health damage costs.\"/>\n\n\n###Regional variations in pollution removal by vegetation\n\nTable 1 presents the top five regions that removed the greatest amount of pollution per hectare (an area roughly the same size as a rugby pitch or London’s Trafalgar Square) in 2015. Those that removed the least amount are also presented.\n\nThe majority of regions estimated to remove the greatest amount of pollution per hectare are in the East of England. Five of the regions estimated as removing the least amount of pollution are in London. \n\nThe regions with the highest and lowest valuations based on avoided health damage costs per resident are also presented in Table 1. All regions with the highest valuations are in England. Again, those regions with the lowest valuations are much more rural, three of which being remote areas of Scotland.\n\n<ons-table-v2 path=\"4ec1d229\" />\n\n\n  [1]: http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/524081/\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/methodologies/naturalcapital"

      "markdown": "The monetary value takes into account avoided health damage costs to people – the more people that benefit from the removal of pollution the higher the value. As a result, population density is a major determinant of the final valuation.\n\nConcentrations of pollutants are generally higher near to and within cities than in remote rural areas, so there is more pollution to remove. In addition, urban residents benefit from pollution removed by vegetation in rural areas adjacent to their area.  \n\n"

      "title": "Which pollutants are most harmful? ",
      "markdown": "The vast majority (88%) of the estimated total monetary value of air pollutant filtration by vegetation results from the removal of PM~2.5~. For a breakdown of valuations by country please see the reference tables. \n\nMost PM~2.5~ is man-made, and is emitted during the [combustion of solid and liquid fuels][1], such as from diesel and petrol cars, power plants and domestic heating.\n\nDue to their small size, PM~2.5~ can stay in the air longer than heavier particles, increasing the likelihood of inhalation. This can be damaging to human health as they can bypass the nose and throat and penetrate deep into the lungs, triggering chronic disease such as asthma, heart disease, bronchitis, and other respiratory problems.\n\nWhile 89% of the value of avoided health damage costs are attributable to the removal of PM~2.5~, this pollutant accounts for less than 2% of the physical volume of pollution removed from the atmosphere.\n\n\n<ons-chart path=\"58e50670\" />\n\n\nThe type of habitat in the region will affect how much air pollution is removed by vegetation since some types of land cover remove more pollutants than others. For the UK as a whole, woodlands are estimated to account for over 80% of all PM~2.5~ removed by vegetation, despite only accounting for 12% of the UK land area. Enclosed farmland is the next biggest contributor to the removal of PM~2.5~, but this only accounts for 11% of all PM~2.5~ removed by vegetation.\n\nAlthough the overall value of removing pollution is significant, the study shows that natural vegetation can only play part of the role of cleaning up air pollution and needs to be considered alongside other pollution reduction measures.\n\nIt is also recognised that at very localised scales (for example street level) the effects of vegetation on air quality depends upon the species composition and can be positive or negative. The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) study was unable to model this level of detail.\n\nAir pollution removal is only one of a number of important cultural and regulating services provided by vegetation. Methods are being developed to incorporate the values of these services within the UK natural capital accounts, see our [natural capital][2] website for more information. However, the approach used for valuation is subject to review, so it is possible the figures might change.\n\n###Footnotes\n\n1. All estimates are classified as experimental and are subject to revision as the UK natural capital accounts are developed.\n\n2. An estimated 112 million kilograms of PM~2.5~ were emitted in the UK in 2015, for more information see the [Defra air emission statistics][3].\n\n3. All avoided health damage costs throughout the article are in 2012 prices. Avoided damage costs cause by Ammonia (NH~3~) and PM~10~ are covered by PM~2.5~ as this includes the aerosol fraction that derives from NH~3~ and PM~2.5~ is the most damaging component of PM~10~.\n\n4. Depending upon the type of trees and their location, vegetation can also have adverse impacts on air quality especially in urban areas, for example by trapping pollutants under the canopy and through emissions of other pollutants such as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs).\n\n\n  [1]: https://laqm.defra.gov.uk/public-health/pm25.html\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/uksectoraccounts/methodologies/naturalcapital\n  [3]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/env01-emissions-of-air-pollutants"

By 1990, this had gone up to an average of 1.83 children.

Fertility rates for women in their 20s went down, but rose in the 2000s for women in their 30s.\n\nThroughout the 2000s, women in their late 20s were also having more children on average, and there were also more foreign-born women of childbearing age living in the UK, who tend to have higher fertility rates than women born here.\n\nThis explains why the number of 18-year-olds in the UK population is projected to rise again throughout the 2020s.\n\n<img src=\"/resource?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationprojections/articles/being18in2018/2018-09-13/af6c345f.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Multiple charts, representing life expectancy\">\n###18-year-olds expected to live two years longer than 18-year-olds in 2000\n\n18-year-olds in 2000 could expect to live until their late 80s.

Those who do tend to be women: they’re three times as likely as men to get married at 18, reflecting the fact that in opposite-sex couples, women tend to be younger than their husbands.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2005, the marriage rates for 18-year-olds fell dramatically, by 30% for men and 40% for women. This may have been because of rules introduced in early 2005 aimed at preventing “sham marriages”. Marriage rates for all ages fell around then, but the large decrease for 18-year-olds suggests that young people, especially women, were particularly affected.\n\nThe overall reduction in the rate of 18-year-olds getting married reflects the fact that people are marrying later: the average age of people getting married for the first time has been rising steadily since the early 1970s.\n\nOne of the biggest changes to marriage since the start of the millennium came in March 2014, when the law changed so that people of the same sex could marry. So far, same-sex couples have been marrying at an older age than opposite-sex couples.\n####Average age at first marriage, England and Wales, 1970 to 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc535/static-charts/marrying/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Average age at first marriage, England and Wales, 1970 to 2015\"/>\n[Download the data][5]\n\n<img src=\"/resource?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationprojections/articles/being18in2018/2018-09-13/9bedf7d3.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Pregnancy test showing positive result\">\n###Far fewer 18-year-old mums and dads\n\nSince 2000 there’s been a big drop in the number of babies born to 18-year-old parents. The birth rate for women aged 18 fell by 58% between 2000 and 2016, while for men aged 18, the birth rate dropped by 41%.\n####Number of live births to 18-year-old parents per 1,000 people aged 18, UK, 2000 to 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc535/static-charts/birthrates/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Number of live births to 18-year-old parents per 1,000 people aged 18, UK, 2000 to 2016\"/>\n[Download the data][6]\n\nThe fall in the birth rate for 18-year-olds partly reflects the fact that for more than 40 years, people have been having children later in life. By 2016, the average age of a first-time mother in England and Wales had risen to almost 29.\n\nIn addition, governments around the UK have tried to reduce the number of teenage pregnancies. A [government strategy in 1999][7] aimed to halve the under-18 pregnancy rate in England by 2010 through, for example, introducing better sex education and improving access to contraception and sexual health services.\n\nOther social changes are thought to have had an effect, including the big rise in the number of young women going to university, a perceived stigma around being a teenage mother, and the easier access via phones and tablets to information about sex, relationships and contraception.\n\n<img src=\"/resource?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationprojections/articles/being18in2018/2018-09-13/44beb68a.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Magnifying glass showing the word JOBS\">\n###Working 18-year-olds outnumbered by those who don't work\n\nThe 2008 recession had a big impact on the working lives of young people. The number of 18-year-olds in work had been going down for several years, but there was a steeper decline in employment in the wake of the economic downturn.\n\nSince then, the number of 18-year-olds in work has usually been outnumbered by those who are neither looking for, nor available for, work – people known as “economically inactive”. These include many of the 18-year-olds in higher education, whose numbers continue to rise.\n####Employment, unemployment and inactivity of 18-year-olds, UK, 2000 to 2017 (October to December each year, not seasonally adjusted)\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc535/static-charts/employment/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Employment, unemployment and inactivity of 18-year-olds, UK, 2000 to 2017 (October to December each year, not seasonally adjusted)\"/>\n[Download the data][8]\n\nCurrently around 43% of 18-year-olds are working; this compares with 60% at the start of the millennium. But the number of 18-year-olds who are unemployed – people who don’t have a job, but have been looking for one and are available to start work – isn’t much higher than it was in 2000.\n\nInstead, there’s been a big increase in the number of 18-year-olds who are “economically inactive”. This can include students – if they aren’t working or looking for work alongside their studies – and there are more of them than ever.\n\nThere has been a long-term trend in the UK of people remaining in education beyond 16 and beyond 18. In 2017, there were a record number of 18-year-olds from the UK (241,500) accepted at British universities – representing one in three of the 18-year-old population.\n\n###Proportion of the 18-year-old population accepted onto an undergraduate higher education course, UK, admissions cycles 2006 to 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc535/static-charts/tuition_fees/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of the 18-year-old population accepted onto an undergraduate higher education course, UK, admissions cycles 2006 to 2017\"/>\n[Download the data][9]\n\n<img src=\"/resource?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationprojections/articles/being18in2018/2018-09-13/5509d5af.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Pint of beer and cigarette in ashtray\">\n###“Generation Sensible”? Drinking and smoking in decline\n\nThey’ve been labelled “[Generation Sensible][10]” – young people who are shunning alcohol, tobacco and even sex.\n\nDrinking and smoking do seem to be in decline: only around half of 18- to 24-year-olds had drunk alcohol in the previous week, while less than a quarter of 18- to 24-year olds smoke.\n\n###People aged 18 to 24 years who drank, or “binged” in the week before interview, Great Britain, 2005 to 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc535/static-charts/drinking/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"People aged 18 to 24 years who drank, or “binged” in the week before interview, Great Britain, 2005 to 2017\"/>\n[Download the data][11]\n\nThe 18-year-olds of the new millennium may have been “peak drinkers”. [Research in 1998 and 1999 by the Home Office][12] found that four out of five people aged 18 to 24 had drank alcohol in the last week.\n\nWhen the Office for National Statistics started measuring drinking habits in 2005, around two-thirds (66%) of young people had had a drink in the previous week. By 2017, this had fallen to 53%, with women more likely (57%) to have drunk alcohol than men (50%).\n\nBinge drinking is defined as men drinking 8 units of alcohol (around 4 pints of beer or 600ml of wine) or women drinking 6 units (3 pints of beer or 450ml of wine) on their heaviest drinking day. Back in 2005, around one in three young people (32%) had binged in the previous week; this figure has come down to less than one in four in 2017.\n\nThe decline in smoking among young people since 2000 has been more dramatic, perhaps helped along by governments around the UK banning smoking in workplaces and enclosed public spaces, raising the legal age to purchase tobacco from 16 to 18, outlawing the display of tobacco products in shops, and introducing compulsory plain packaging.\n\n####People aged 18 to 24 years who are cigarette smokers, Great Britain, 2000 to 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc535/static-charts/smoking/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"People aged 18 to 24 years who are cigarette smokers, Great Britain, 2000 to 2017\"/>\n[Download the data][13]\n\nAt the same time, we’ve seen the arrival of e-cigarettes, which are often used as an alternative to tobacco, or as an aid to help stop smoking.\n\n<img src=\"/resource?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationprojections/articles/being18in2018/2018-09-13/ff02f1b8.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Smartphone on selfie stick with app icons\">\n###Is time up for TV?\n\n18-year-olds spend almost half an hour less per day socialising than 18-year-olds at the start of the millennium, while time spent watching and listening to films, TV and radio back in 2000 to 2001 seems to have been replaced in 2014 to 2015 by time using computers and gaming.\n\n####Change in time spent by 18-year-olds on selected activities between 2000 to 2001 and 2014 to 2015 (average minutes per day)\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc535/static-charts/time_use/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Change in time spent by 18-year-olds on selected activities between 2000 to 2001 and 2014 to 2015 (average minutes per day)\"/>\n[Download the data][14]\n\nThe internet was a very different place at the start of the century – with no Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube or Instagram – and no smartphones or tablets to access it. The biggest changes to how 18-year-olds spend their time may be driven in part by the rise of digital technology.\n\nTime 18-year-olds spent socialising, which includes meeting friends and family, visiting pubs or cafes, or talking on the phone, declined by 27 minutes per day between 2000 to 2001 and 2014 to 2015.\n\nTime spent computing, which includes using social media, went up by 17 minutes per day, while 18-year-olds spent an additional 31 minutes playing games including computer games. There was also a rise in the amount of time spent on sport and exercise, up by 8 minutes per day. Perhaps another sign of “Generation Sensible”?\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc535/downloadthedata/18populationestimatesprojections.csv\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc535/downloadthedata/18totalfertilityrateUK.csv\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc535/downloadthedata/18lifeexpectancy.csv\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc535/downloadthedata/18marriagerateUK.csv\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc535/downloadthedata/18averageagemarriageEW.csv\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc535/downloadthedata/18birthrateUK.csv\n  [7]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100202154438/http:/www.dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/healthandwellbeing/teenagepregnancy/about/strategy/\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc535/downloadthedata/18employment.csv\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc535/downloadthedata/18highereducation.csv\n  [10]: https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2018/07/whats-up-with-generation-sensible/\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc535/downloadthedata/18alcohol.csv\n  [12]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110218144400/http:/rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/hors263.pdf\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc535/downloadthedata/18smoking.csv\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc535/downloadthedata/18timeuse.csv"

      "markdown": "One in eight young people without degree-level qualifications are working in graduate jobs, according to analysis by the Office for National Statistics.\n\nIn 2017, 12% of non-graduates (327,303) aged 22 to 29 were working in a graduate job  – defined as a role where the tasks typically require knowledge and skills gained through higher education. This compares with 54% of graduates (1,273,336) in the same age group who had a graduate job.\n\n###Sales, HR, and retail and wholesale management most common graduate jobs for non-graduates\n\nSome types of graduate jobs were especially common for those without degrees. These include sales, HR and retail and wholesale management.\n<ons-table path=\"e20786e0\" />\nNOTE: Salaries are median, full-time and do not include the self-employed.<br>\nSource: Annual Population Survey, Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings\n\nIn these types of job, it may be easier for non-graduates to “work their way up” to senior positions without formal qualifications, unlike in more regulated professions like medicine, law and teaching. In addition, [apprenticeships are more established][1] in retail and sales, enabling school leavers to obtain on-the-job training.\n\n###Fewer non-graduates in work\n\nOverall, [graduates][2] and non-graduates face different experiences in the jobs market. People aged 22 to 29 without a degree have a lower employment rate (78%) than graduates (90%). Although unemployment rates, those actively looking for a job, are slightly higher for non-graduates at 6.8% compared with 4.6% for graduates.\n\nThe biggest difference between the two groups is in the numbers who are neither employed nor unemployed. These are people described as “economically inactive”^1^ who are not available for or looking for work. 17% of non-graduates aged 22 to 29 were inactive, compared to only 6% of graduates.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"27822579\" />\n\nMost of these non-graduates said they were not working because they were long-term sick, or looking after the family or home. There may be more non-graduates who are long-term sick because higher levels of education are [associated with better health][3] and well-being. There may also be more non-graduates looking after the family or home because women with lower educational attainment [tend to have children younger][4], at an average age of 28.5 compared with 32.9 for graduates.\n\n###Non-graduates work in lower-skilled, lower-paid jobs\n\nPeople without degree-level qualifications mainly work in lower-skilled and lower-paid jobs. 61% of non-graduates aged 22 to 29 work in four job types:\n\n- [elementary jobs][7] (for example cleaner, warehouse work, security guard)</br>\n- skilled trades (for example building, plumbing)</br>\n- care</br>\n- sales and customer services</br>\n\nIn contrast, 58% of graduates in the same age group work two job types:\n\n- [professional][8] (for example teacher, doctor, lawyer)</br>\n- associate professional (for example sales, marketing, IT)</br>\n\n####Occupations of non-graduates aged 22 to 29, UK, 2017\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc533/nongraduates.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Occupations of non-graduates aged 22 to 29, UK, 2017\"/>\n\n<a href=\"/visualisations/dvc533/data1.csv\">Download the data</a>\n\n####Occupations of graduates aged 22 to 29, UK, 2017\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc533/graduates.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Occupations of graduates aged 22 to 29, UK, 2017\"/>\n<a href=\"/visualisations/dvc533/data2.csv\">Download the data</a>\n\nThere’s a big pay gap between mainly-graduate and mainly-non-graduate jobs: young people in “professional” roles earn almost two-thirds more (63%) than their peers in “elementary” roles, and this pay gap has remained the same since 2008.\n\nThe highest-paid non-graduate roles are in skilled trades – these may earn more because their qualifications match the industry they work in and they have greater access to training on the job. Young people working in skilled trades have seen the greatest pay increase at 11%.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"3b3ba6e0\" /> \n\n###Footnotes: \n\n1.

Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis shows that names given to babies differ even by local authority within England and Wales.\n\nLast year, there were [679,106 live births][1], with babies being given 63,697 distinct names and with just 73 unique names ranking first across 347 local areas.\n\nThe top 10 boys’ names nationally were given to 13% of all boys born last year, whereas the top 10 girls’ names were given to 10% of girls. Since there are so many different names given to babies, even the most popular names are only given to a relatively small proportion of all babies named overall.\n\nAnalysis suggests that boys’ names are more homogenous, with there being a comparatively narrower selection of names (7,000 fewer) despite there being 17,000 more boys than girls born in 2017.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc526/rank/rank/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Top baby names in your area\"/>\n[Source: Baby names in England and Wales: 2017][2]\n\n[Download the data][3]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/birthsummarytablesenglandandwales/2017\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/babynamesenglandandwales/2017\n  [3]: /visualisations/dvc526/downloadthedata/rankdata.xlsx"

      "markdown": "Last year, new parents across England and Wales called 348,071 newborn boys one of 28,222 unique names.\n\nThe top three boys’ names in 2017 were Oliver, Harry and George. These three names ranked first in 63% of local authorities^1^ across England and Wales, suggesting that these names are broadly popular across the whole country. There were 30 other boys' names ranked first in local authorities, including Jack, Muhammad and Noah.\n\nThe names Jack and Noah ranked first in 17 and 15 different local authorities respectively, and came fifth and fourth overall in the top names rankings for England and Wales as a whole. Muhammad was the highest ranked boys’ name in 35 local authority areas, but overall is only the tenth most popular name in England and Wales, suggesting that its popularity is specific to certain areas. Muhammad and other similar spellings are common Muslim names that [frequently feature in the top 100][1].\n\nMuhammad is also the name that makes up the highest proportion of names given to boys in any given local area. In Pendle in Lancashire, 9.9% of baby boys born in 2017 – 60 out of 606 – were called Muhammad.\n\nMost of the names that were ranked first in a local authority are in the top 100 but there are some names that do not appear at all in the top 100 but rank first in an area.\n\nIn Gwynedd, Wales, the name Hari is the most popular given to boys, with 12 boys called Hari in 2017. In Ceredigion, Jac and Osian both come up top, with seven baby boys called these names. Jac is a Welsh language variant of Jack – there is no K in the Welsh alphabet. Osian is a Welsh name, derived from Oisín the Irish poet and warrior, and Hari is a “Cymricised” or Welsh version of the English name Harry. All three of these names are in the top 100 names for Wales. At the last census in 2011, 65% of people living in Gwynedd and 47% of people living in Ceredigion were Welsh speakers, which may explain these names.\n\n###David is an unusually popular name in north west London\n\nWhile David is still a popular name nationally, its popularity has declined in recent years (it ranks 44th nationally, compared with 32nd in 1996 and first in 1954 and 1964), but it is unusually popular in specific areas. David ranks first in five local authorities: Corby, Barnet, Brent, Hackney and Harrow. Four of those areas where David is the most popular name are in London and three of them are neighbouring areas. The name David has links to Jewish, Christian and Islamic religious tradition. Nationally, about 1% of the population in England and Wales identified as Jewish in terms of religion, according to the 2011 Census. In three of the areas where David is unusually popular, a higher proportion of the population identified as Jewish, with Corby and Brent being the exception^2^.\n\nThis suggests that in areas where David is most popular, the religious make-up of the area could be influencing name choice.\n\n####Explore the top 100 boys’ names by area\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc526/mappercent/mapboys/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Explore the top 100 boysâ€™ names by area\"/>\n[Source: Baby names in England and Wales: 2017][2]\n\n[Download the data][3]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/articles/thepopularityofthenamemuhammadmohammedmohammad/2016-09-02\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/babynamesenglandandwales/2017\n  [3]: /visualisations/dvc526/downloadthedata/mapdata.xlsx"

Together, they ranked first in 74% of local authorities across England and Wales, suggesting that these particular names are broadly popular across the country regardless of area. There were 37 other names given to girls that ranked top in a given local area, including Imogen, Poppy and Harper. For girls, the top three names were ranked first in a greater proportion of local authorities than for boys, however, the remaining local authorities had seven extra different girls' names ranked first than was the case for boys.\n\nAva was the highest ranked name given to girls in 24 local authority areas and is the fourth most popular name nationally, which means it is broadly popular across England and Wales.\n\nThe name that makes up the highest proportion of girls’ names in any given local area is Olivia, in City of London, where the name was given to 7.5% of all baby girls born in the area. However, this was only given to 3 girls out of 40 in the area. \n\nAs with boys’ names, most of the names that were ranked first in a local authority are in the top 100 but there are some areas where names are unexpectedly popular – far more popular than they are nationally. There are also three areas where the most popular name does not feature in the top 100 names nationally.\n\nIn Gwynedd, Efa is the most popular name – 13 babies born there were called Efa last year. In Powys, the most popular name was Ffion with 10 girls given this name. Efa and Ffion are in the top 100 names for Wales. Last year, 12 girls were called Zainab in Blackburn with Darwen and this name was ranked top out of all the names in that area. \n\n###Maryam is an unusually popular name in north east London\nMaryam is the most widespread less popular name. It ranks 78th nationally for girls’ names, but is ranked first in five local authorities: Tower Hamlets, Newham, Redbridge, Luton and Leicester. Three of those are in north-east London. Maryam is an Aramaic form of the name Miriam, or Mary, and is closely linked to Christianity and Islam. Nationally, just 5% of the population in England and Wales were of Muslim religion, according to the 2011 Census. In the areas where Maryam is the most popular name, the proportion of the population that identified as Muslim was notably higher^3^.\n\n####Explore the top 100 girls’ names by area\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc526/mappercent/mapgirls/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Explore the top 100 girlsâ€™ names by area\"/>\n[Source: Baby names in England and Wales: 2017][1]\n\n[Download the data][2]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/babynamesenglandandwales/2017\n  [2]: /visualisations/dvc526/downloadthedata/mapdata.xlsx"

This was due to a small error when the chart template produced the data. We apologise for any inconvenience. \n</ons-box>\n\nWhen you were younger, did you dream of making it as a reality TV star? Or perhaps you wanted to shoot for the stars as an astronaut? Or were your sights set on a more traditional role?\n\nWhatever those aspirations were, Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis has revealed a sizeable difference between those earlier dreams and reality, by comparing the ambitions of those aged 16 to 21 with the realities facing 22 to 29-year-olds today.\n\n###Top five dream jobs\n\nWhile the variety of available jobs has grown with the advent of digital technology, it seems the jobs that young people aspire to has not changed.\n\nIn 2015 to 2016 the top five jobs that 16 to 21-year-olds wanted to do when they were older was unchanged from the top five jobs being sought by the same age group in 2010 to 2011.\n\nHowever, the actual proportions of 22 to 29-year-olds working in those roles in 2017 is much lower.\n\n####Top five jobs chosen by 16 to 21-year-olds, 2011 to 2012, and proportion of 22 to 29-year-olds doing those jobs in 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc543/chart1/tf/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Top five jobs chosen by 16 to 21-year-olds, 2011 to 2012, and proportion of 22 to 29-year-olds doing those jobs in 2017\"/>\n[Data download][1]\n\n######NOTE: \n1. Of the people who were asked what job they wanted to do when they were older, the percentages shown in the chart chose a certain job.\n\n###So, did they end up in their dream jobs? No, not quite…\nTeaching was the only dream job ranked in the top five by 16 to 21-year-olds between 2011 and 2012 in which 22 to 29-year-olds found employment during 2017.\n\nThe job category that most ended up working in was as sales assistants and retail cashiers, which has been the case since 2011. We can see certain jobs falling in and out favour, with IT professionals jumping up the ranks by 2017, and construction taking the biggest fall in rank. \n\n####Top 10 jobs in which 22 to 29-year-olds work, 2011 compared with 2017  \n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc543/slope/scb/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Top 10 jobs in which 22 to 29-year-olds work, 2011 compared with 2017\"/>\n[Data download][2]\n\n###Expected earnings versus reality\nONS research has found that in 2015 to 2016, 24% of young people (aged 16 to 21) felt a high income was very important to them in their occupation, whereas 86% felt it was very important and important. If the expectations of 16 to 17-year-olds is anything to go by, they are vastly different to reality.\n\nFor example, half of 16 to 17-year-olds expected to earn £35,000 by the age of 30 if they’d achieved a degree and £25,000 if they did not have a degree.\n\nData from the [Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings][3] (ASHE) gave an indication of that difference by showing that the average salary of a 30-year-old was £23,700.\n\n\n####Expected earnings of young people (aged 16 to 21) by age 30, 2015 to 2016, compared with 30-year-olds' earnings, 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc543/dist/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Expected earnings of young people (aged 16 to 21) by age 30, 2015 to 2016, compared with 30-year-olds' earnings, 2017\"/>\n[Data download][4]\n\n###Degree \nAlmost half of 16 to 21-year-olds (48%) in 2015 to 2016 thought it was very likely that they would go into higher education. In reality, 38% of young people (aged 22 to 29) had degrees as their highest qualification in 2017. \n\nSome of those young people were much more ambitious in their expectations for their future earning potential, with 5% thinking they could earn £80,000 or more at the age of 30. In reality, 2% of 30-year-olds earned £80,000.  \n\n###Security and satisfaction \nJob satisfaction and security were much more important to young people than a high income, the analysis discovered. In 2015 to 2016, 71% of them thought that having an interesting job was very important, while 60% felt that job security was very important.\n\nThis figure has only increased by three percentage points since 2010 to 2011, despite the increase in zero-hour contracts and the so-called [gig economy.][5] \n\nIn fact, 85% of young people (aged 22 to 29) had permanent jobs. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"a741a516\" />\n\n  [1]: /visualisations/dvc543/datadownload/chart1.csv\n  [2]: /visualisations/dvc543/datadownload/chart2.csv\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2017provisionaland2016revisedresults\n  [4]: /visualisations/dvc543/datadownload/chart3.csv\n  [5]: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38930048"

More than half (53%) of 22- to 29-year-olds had no money saved in a savings account or an Individual Savings Account (ISA) in 2014 to 2016, compared with 41% in 2008 to 2010. However, those who did had an average of £1,600 put away, up from £900.\n\nMeanwhile, young people are now less likely to be in financial debt. Around 37% had financial debt (excluding student loans from the Student Loans Company), down from 49% in 2008 to 2010. That said, those in debt owed fractionally more (£1,900), on average, than in 2008 to 2010 (£1,800).\n\nClearly, not all young people face the same financial pressures. \n\nMuch depends on where people sit on the earnings scale. The highest earning 10% of 22- to 29-year-olds were paid at least 4.3 times as much per week as the lowest earners in 2017^2^. \n\nThe gap is wider still for those with savings in savings accounts or ISAs (47%). The top 10% of savers had at least £15,000 put away in 2014 to 2016, while the bottom 10% had saved less than £100. \n\nLikewise, there are differences in levels of financial debt. Among 22 to 29 year olds with debt (37%), the 10% most indebted owed at least £14,200 in 2014 to 2016, while the 10% least indebted owed £100 or less.\n\nHow does your financial situation compare?

However, just one-fifth of that rise was due to new investment in the UK (£155 billion).\n\nThe rise was instead driven by currency and price changes^2^. The British pound depreciated to its lowest value since the financial crisis following the Brexit vote, which increased the value of deposits held in UK banks (mostly denominated in foreign currency) when converted back into sterling.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/unitedkingdombalanceofpaymentsthepinkbook/2018"

[Prime Minister Theresa May has announced plans to increase investment in Africa after Brexit][1] during a recent visit.\n\nWhile UK investment in Africa has risen by 61% since 2008, investment in Europe has dropped by 20% in the same period.

If an economy is stable and seen as a safe place to invest, it may be more attractive to investors than somewhere perceived as riskier, albeit with higher expected returns. \n\nFor example, the typically stable economies of the US, France and Germany, which make up 44% of UK investment overseas, provide some of the lowest rates of return.\n\nOther factors affecting investment decisions include price levels, interest rates and tax laws. For example, Ireland – the sixth-largest destination for UK investment – has one of the lowest rates of Corporation Tax in Europe (12.5%).\n\n####There is little correlation between investment levels and rate of return\n**Values of and rates of return on UK investment overseas, top 10 investment partners, 2017**\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc558/investment/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"There is little correlation between investment levels and rate of return **Values of and rates of return on UK investment overseas, top 10 investment partners, 2017**\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc558/investment/downloadthedata.csv"

In these cases, it is not possible to determine if the victim knew the perpetrator.\n\n\nA statistic often quoted is that two women a week are killed by their current or former partner. This number fluctuates. The average number of women killed per week using the latest data for the year ending March 2018 is 1.2. Rounding this number causes inaccuracies in the statistics. For example, rounding this number down to one would equate to 52 women over a year, 11 less than the actual total^2^ of 63. \n\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc652/q3womenkilled/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Women homicides, England and Wales, year ending March 2019\"/>\n\n######Source: Home Office – Homicide Index\n\n[Download the data][1]\n\nUsing the same method, the average number of men killed each week by their current or former partner is 0.13.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc530/banners/svgs_section_4.svg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Banner image\" style=\"margin-bottom: -56px;max-width:100%;\">\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc652/q3womenkilled/datadownload.csv"

In this area, 7 out of 41 roads are relatively green, while 18 would count as not very green at all. On average, there is 35% vegetation visible at ground level on these streets. It’s followed by Lisvane with 32% greenery, and then Pontprennau, where the streets have, on average, 29% vegetation.\n\nPerhaps unsurprising to people who know the city, Riverside is the least green area. In Riverside, only 1 out of 73 roads would qualify as being relatively green, with the majority of roads having no vegetation (less than 1%). Cathays, Splott and Adamsdown follow Riverside, and all have less than 10% vegetation, on average, along their streets.

It is worth noting that this is another long country road in the same area – the roads actually lead onto each other.\n\nOld Mill Road in the leafy suburb of Lisvane is third on the list, with 81% greenery, followed by Jindabyne Court (off Druidstone Road) in Old St Mellons and Wild Gardens Road, with 81% and 77% vegetation respectively. With the exception of Wild Gardens Road, which separates two parts of Roath Park with no houses, these roads are lined with dwellings that tend to be detached homes with front gardens.\n\nOn the other end of the scale, the road with the least amount of greenery along it is Scott Road, which is in the centre of the city, right near the Principality Stadium and surrounded by high buildings and concrete on all sides. It has exactly 0% vegetation along it.\n\nMost of the streets that feature near the bottom of the scale when it comes to vegetation are on industrial sites such as near the docks, or on industrial estates that feature warehouse units. But some streets where people live, like Devon Street, Warwick Street and Chester Street – all in Grangetown – have less than 1% vegetation along them.\n\nOverall, the city becomes greener the further north you travel.\n"

      "markdown": "More than 11,000 pubs have closed in the UK in the last decade – a fall of almost a quarter (23%). Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis shows that it’s small pubs that are disappearing, as the big pub chains consolidate their businesses around bigger bars.\n\nThe closure of British pubs is a well-known story. Organisations like the [Campaign for Real Ale][1] (CAMRA) and the [British Beer and Pub Association][2] have charted the disappearance of pubs for many years.\n\nONS data confirm the large fall in the number of pubs, from around 50,000 pubs in 2008 to around 39,000 pubs in 2018.\n\n###Almost one in four pubs have closed since 2008\n####Number of pubs and bars, UK, 2001 to 2018\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc566/chart1/Line/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Number of pubs and bars, UK, 2001 to 2018\"/>\n[Download the data][3]\n\nBut these figures don’t tell the full story of how the UK pub trade is doing. Although lots of pubs have closed, the total turnover of pubs and bars has held up, remaining flat since 2008, once inflation is taken into account. The remaining pubs and bars appear to have soaked up the custom from those pubs that have closed down.\n\n###Turnover stable since recession\n####Turnover of pubs and bars, UK, 2001 to 2016\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc566/chart2/Line/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Turnover of pubs and bars, UK, 2001 to 2016\"/>\n[Download the data][4]\n\nEmployment figures back this up: while the number of jobs in pubs dipped during the economic downturn, there are now 6% more jobs in pubs and bars than there were in 2008. The largest increases have been in bigger pubs (those with 10 or more employees). This may be because pubs are increasingly focussed on serving food as well as drink, which requires more waiting and kitchen staff.\n\n###More jobs in pubs, especially big ones\n####Employment in pubs and bars, by numbers of employees per pub, UK, 2001 to 2018\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc566/chart3/Stacked-Bar-Vertical/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Employment in pubs and bars, by numbers of employees per pub, UK, 2001 to 2018\"/>\n[Download the data][5]\n\nIn 2008, pubs in the UK had a median number of five employees. By 2018, partly due to the closure of many smaller pubs, this had increased to eight employees.\n\nThe rise in employment has been more pronounced in rural pubs, where in 2018 total employment in England and Wales is up 17% compared with 2008. In contrast, total employment in urban pubs rose by only 4% over the same period.\n\nMost jobs in the sector are low paid: around 70% of workers in pubs and bars are paid less than the Living Wage Foundation’s Living Wage. This rate, currently £10.55 per hour in London and £9 per hour elsewhere, is sometimes called the “real” living wage, and is based upon full-time workers being able to afford a basic set of goods and services.\n\n###What's happened to your local?\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc566/interactive/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"What's happened to your local?\"/>\n[Download the data][6]\n\n###Outer-city areas see pub numbers plummet\nMany areas on the edges of big cities, and in the commuter belt, have seen the biggest declines in the number of pubs. Barking and Dagenham, Newham and Luton – all in and around London – now have fewer than half the pubs they did in 2001.\n\nLikewise, there are far fewer pubs in some areas around Manchester, including Burnley, Bolton and Rochdale, as well as on the outskirts of Birmingham, in areas including Sandwell, Dudley and Walsall.\n\nIn Wales, Torfaen (near Newport) was the area to have lost the most pubs. In Scotland, East Renfewshire and East Ayrshire (both south of Glasgow) saw pub numbers decline the most. All areas of Northern Ireland have seen pubs close their doors, with numbers down by more than a third between 2001 and 2018.\n\n###Tourism – propping up the bars?\nThe areas where pub numbers have held up – or even increased – include several popular tourist areas, such as Highland Scotland, Ceredigion in West Wales, and South Lakeland, as well as many seaside towns like Scarborough, Blackpool and Brighton.\n\nPub numbers also remained stable in some cities, including Newcastle, Milton Keynes, York, and in the London borough of Hackney.\n\n###Explore what’s happened to pubs across the UK\n####% change in number of pubs by local authority, UK, 2001 to 2018\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc566/map/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"% change in number of pubs by local authority, UK, 2001 to 2018\"/>\n[Download the data][7]\n\n###Last orders for small pubs?\nMost pubs in the UK are small, independently owned businesses – and it is mainly these kinds of pub that have closed over the last decade. But the number of independently-owned larger pubs is steadily rising.\n\n####Independent pubs by employee numbers, UK, 2001 to 2018\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc566/chart4/independant/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Independent pubs by employee numbers, UK, 2001 to 2018\"/>\n[Download the data][8]\n\nMeanwhile, small pub chains, which are often regional, family-owned businesses, have also switched their focus away from small pubs towards medium and large bars.\n\nAnd at the same time, the large “pubcos” (nationwide companies with 250 or more outlets) have almost completely abandoned small pubs, disposing of lots of them in the early 2000s, concentrating instead on their bigger bars.\n\n####Pubs owned by enterprises with 250 or more units, by employee numbers, UK, 2001 to 2018\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc566/chart5/smallandlargechain/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Pubs owned by enterprises with 250 or more units, by employee numbers, UK, 2001 to 2018\"/>\n[Download the data][9]\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.camra.org.uk/news/-/asset_publisher/1dUgQCmQMoVC/content/pub-closures-are-making-us-all-poorer-says-camra\n  [2]: https://beerandpub.com/statistics/pub-numbers/\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc566/chart1_download.csv\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc566/chart2_download.csv\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc566/chart3_download.csv\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/datasets/publichousesandbarsbylocalauthority\n  [7]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc566/map_download.csv\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc566/chart4_download.csv\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc566/chart5_download.csv"

Personal reasons, such as a lack of confidence also showed themselves as an issue for a higher proportion of women than men.\n\nOne possible reason for this could be the [higher proportion of women who carry out household tasks][4]. ONS time use data showed that women carried out an overall average of 60% more unpaid work than men.\n\nThe division between the sexes was also visible when it came to improving career potential.

These factors, combined with the rise in the number of people staying in education and not in full-time work, may be factors in encouraging young adults to remain living with their parents.\n\n<h3 id=\"partner\">Age 27: Moving in with a partner</h3>\n<div id=\"timeline4\" style=\"position:relative\"></div>\n<script>var pymParent = new pym.Parent('timeline4', '/visualisations/dvc583/timeline/timeline/index.html#partner', {});</script>\n\n<p style=\"margin-top:-50px\">The age at which people move in with a partner has not changed much over the last couple of decades and has fluctuated between 26 and 27.</p>\n\nMore than 50% of 27-year-olds were living with a partner in 2017.

      "markdown": "Around 1.5 million jobs in England are at high risk of some of their duties and tasks being automated in the future, Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis shows.\n\nThe ONS has analysed the jobs of 20 million people^1^ in England in 2017, and has found that 7.4% are at high risk of automation.\n\nAutomation involves replacing tasks currently done by workers with technology, which could include computer programs, algorithms, or even robots. \n\nWomen, young people, and those who work part-time are most likely to work in roles that are at high risk of automation.\n\nIt is important to understand automation as it may have an impact on the labour market, economy and society.\n\nThe proportion of jobs at a high risk of automation decreased slightly between 2011 and 2017, from 8.1% to 7.4%, while the proportion of jobs at low and medium risk of automation has risen.\n\nThe exact reasons for the decrease in the proportion of roles at high risk of automation are unclear, but it is possible that automation of some jobs has already happened. For instance, self-checkouts at supermarkets are now a common sight, reducing the need to have as many employees working at checkouts. Additionally, while the overall number of jobs has increased, the majority of these are in occupations that are at low or medium risk, suggesting that the labour market may be changing to jobs that require more complex and less routine skills.\n\n#####Find out more about automation using our chat bot:\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc599/chatbot/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Job automation chatbot\"/>\n[Download the data][1]\n\nThe analysis looked at the tasks performed by people in jobs across the whole labour market, to assess the probability that some of these tasks could be replaced through automation.\n\nIt is not so much that robots are taking over, but that routine and repetitive tasks can be carried out more quickly and efficiently by an algorithm written by a human, or a machine designed for one specific function. The risk of automation tends to be higher for lower-skilled roles for this reason.\n\nWhen considering the overall risk of automation, the three occupations with the highest probability of automation are waiters and waitresses, shelf fillers and elementary sales occupations, all of which are low skilled or routine.\n\nThe three occupations at the lowest risk of automation are medical practitioners, higher education teaching professionals, and senior professionals of educational establishments. These occupations are all considered high skilled.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc599/beeswarm/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Occupation pay explorer\"/>\n[Download the data][2]\n\n###The risk of automation changes depending on where you work\n\nThis is driven by the types of jobs available in a particular area. Generally, the more jobs that require high-skilled workers in an area, the lower the risk of automation overall.\n\nDiscover the risk of automation for occupations where you work:\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc599/automation-by-region/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Probability of automation by region of place of work\"/>\n[Download the data][3]\n\n###How does the risk of a job being automated change depending on age and sex?\n\nThe ONS analysis shows that 70.2% of the roles at high risk of automation are currently held by women. In addition, people aged 20 to 24 years are most likely to be at risk of having their job automated, when compared with other age groups.\n\nYounger people are more likely to be in roles affected by job automation. Of those aged 20 to 24 years who are employed, 15.7% were in jobs at high risk of automation. The risk of job automation decreases for older workers, and is lowest for workers aged between 35 and 39 years. Just 1.3% of people in this age bracket are in roles at high risk of automation. The risk then increases from the age group 40 to 44 upwards.\n\n####Young people are more at risk of job automation\n<strong>Proportion of people at high risk of automation, by age, 2017, England</strong>\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc599/automation-by-age/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Young people are more at risk of job automation Proportion of people at high risk of automation, by age, 2017, England\"/>\n[Download the data][4]\n\nThis pattern can be explained by the fact that workers naturally obtain further skills and become more knowledgeable in their field as they progress further in their careers. When young workers enter the labour market, they may be entering part-time roles and employed in industries like sales, retail, and other roles where some degree of automation is highly likely. Many young workers may move through a range of roles before settling into a career. In addition, younger workers have more time and opportunity to retrain or change career paths.\n\nWe can partially explain the increase in the risk of automation from the age of 35 years with the change in working patterns, particularly for women. From the age of 30 years, more women work part-time, and this increases until women reach the age of 50 years, when it then steadily drops down. People who work part-time are more likely to work in roles at a higher risk of automation, but ultimately your occupation determines the probability of automation, not your working pattern.\n\n####Notes\n\nAn occupation is considered at high risk of automation when its probability of automation is above 70%.\n\nThere is a [methodology article][5] available if you want to understand more about the analysis and the methodology.\n\n1. Due to our methodology, this does not equal the total working population, or the total number of jobs, in England in 2017. A number of observations could not be included in the analysis due to missing responses in the data used.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc599/chatbot/data/data.xlsx\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc599/beeswarm/data.xlsx\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc599/automation-by-region/data/data.xlsx\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc599/automation-by-age/data.xlsx\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/theprobabilityofautomationinengland/2011and2017"

Though it should be noted, that these factors are not necessarily the cause of the mental disorders.\n\nIn measuring family functioning, researchers looked at issues such as whether family members show affection for one another, whether they communicate openly or whether emotional upsets were resolved.\n\nIn its report, [Family Breakdown][3], the Centre for Social Justice describes the family environment as the place where “an individual’s physical, emotional and psychological development occurs.”\n\n###Parental mental health\n\nAside from how well a family functions, this research revealed that the mental health of parents was also associated with mental disorders in children.\n\nChildren of parents who had difficulties with their own mental health were more likely to  have a mental disorder, when compared with children of parents who did not show signs of a common mental disorder^5^.\n\n####Children whose parents had poor mental health more likely to have a mental disorder\n<strong>Percent of children with a mental disorder by parental mental health and age group, England, 2017</strong>\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc598/chart_pmental/splitbar/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Children whose parents had poor mental health more likely to have a mental disorder Percent of children with a mental disorder by parental mental health and age group, England, 2017\"/>[Data download][4]\n\nResearch by NHS Digital has shown that 3.9 per cent of new or expectant mothers in 2017 were in contact with secondary mental health services. \n\nHowever, a [study from University College London][5] has also suggested a link between depressive symptoms in fathers and similar symptoms in children.  \n\nWhile problems with family functioning or poor parental mental health may contribute to the onset of a mental disorder in children, the presence of a mental disorder in children could also lead to problems with family functioning and a deterioration in parental mental health.\n\n###Welfare benefits\nThe research also found that children of all ages whose parents were in receipt of welfare benefits (which are related to low income or disability) were more likely to have a mental disorder than those whose parents were not in receipt of these benefits.\n\n####Children whose parents receive welfare benefits more likely to experience a mental disorder\n<strong>Percent of children with a mental disorder, by receipt of welfare benefits and age group, England, 2017</strong>\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc598/chart_benefit/splitbar/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Children whose parents receive welfare benefits more likely to experience a mental disorder Percent of children with a mental disorder, by receipt of welfare benefits and age group, England, 2017\"/>[Data download][6]\n\nThe [Mental Health Foundation][7] has said that risk factors such as living in poverty can make some children and young people more likely to experience problems than other children.\n \nIn a recent [report,][8] the Children's Society said: “Reductions in family income, including benefit cuts, are likely to have wide-ranging negative effects on children’s mental health.”\n\n###Family type, marital status and parental qualifications\nThis new analysis has also taken a first look at some additional factors which are linked with higher rates of mental disorder in children.\n\nIt found that children aged 2 to 10 years old living with step-siblings showed around double the rates of mental disorder, than those who did not live with step-siblings. But this higher rate could be associated with problems that may be related to family break-ups, such as divorce, moving house or changing schools.\n\nThis might explain why school aged children (aged 5 to 16 years) from lone parent families experience greater rates of mental disorder, compared with those who live with married parents. This was most noticeable in secondary school aged children (11 to 16 years) of single lone parents (who have never been married).\n\n####Secondary school aged children from single lone parent families experience higher rates of mental disorders\n<strong>Percent of children with a mental disorder by marital status and age group, England, 2017</strong>\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc598/chart_marital/splitbar/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Secondary school aged children from single lone parent families experience higher rates of mental disorders Percent of children with a mental disorder by marital status and age group, England, 2017\"/>[Data download][9]\n\nAnother newly-examined  factor looked at the association between the qualification level of parents and their children’s mental health. It found primary school aged children of parents without qualifications were twice as likely to have a mental disorder as those with qualifications (16.8% and 8.4% respectively).\n\n####5 to 10 year olds whose parents have no qualifications more likely to have a mental disorder\n<strong>Percent of children with a mental disorder by parental qualification and age group, England, 2017</strong>\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc598/chart_qual/splitbar/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"5 to 10 year olds whose parents have no qualifications more likely to have a mental disorder Percent of children with a mental disorder by parental qualification and age group, England, 2017\"/>[Data download][10]\n\n###Explore different factors around mental health and childhood by using our interactive tool\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc598/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Young peoples mental health data explorer\"/>[Data download][11]\n\n###Where to go for help:\n\n- charity [YoungMinds][12] offers advice and information about children and young people’s mental health. \n- call the Parents' Helpline for advice for parents: 0808 802 5544. \n- if you are experiencing difficulties with your mental health and need support, contact YoungMinds Crisis Messenger by texting YM to 85258 or calling Samaritans on 116123\n\n####Notes:\n\n1. The four categories of mental disorder: The term mental disorder is generally used in this report. This is because the survey did not screen for general mental health ‘problems’ or ‘issues’, but applied diagnostic criteria for specific disorders. We are also sensitive, however, to the negative connotations of the word disorder.  \n\n\t#####Emotional disorders (such as depression)\n\n\tThey include a range of different types of anxiety disorders (characterised by fear and worry), depressive disorders (characterised by sadness, loss of interest and energy, and low self-esteem) and a small number of cases of mania and bipolar affective disorder.    \n\n\t#####Behavioural disorders (including oppositional defiant disorder)\n\n\tA group of disorders characterised by repetitive and persistent patterns of disruptive and violent behaviour in which the rights of others, and social norms or rules, are violated. The umbrella term used in ICD-10 is conduct disorders, in this report we have used the term ‘behavioural disorders’ to avoid confusion with the sub-types of disorder included in the survey.  \n\n\t#####Hyperactivity disorders\n\n\tThey are characterised by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. These symptoms lead to impairments in in several settings such as school/work, home life and leisure activities.   \n\n\t#####Other (less common disorders)\n\n\tThey include autism spectrum disorder (ASD), eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, and other types of disorders, including tics.\n\n2. Family functioning:Family functioning was measured using the general functioning scale of the [McMaster Family Activity Device (FAD)][13]. The scale comprises 12 statements which are a self-reported measure of perceived family functioning. They include measures of problem solving, communication, roles, affective responsiveness, affective involvement, behaviour control and general functioning in families.  \n\n3. The Survey of the Mental Health of Children and Young People:The Survey of the Mental Health of Children and Young People 2017 (MHCYP) collected information on about mental health and wellbeing of 9,117 children aged 2 to 19 in England. The survey was conducted by NatCen Social Research, the Office for National Statistics and YouthInMind on behalf of NHS Digital. \n\n4. The data for preschool children (aged 2 to 4 years) are experimental\n\n5. Common mental disorder: The mental health of the interviewed parent or guardian (usually the mother), was assessed using the [General Health Questionnaire][14] (GHQ-12). This is a screening device for identifying minor psychiatric disorders. \n\nScores range from 0 (no psychological distress) to 12 (severe psychological distress). A score of 4 or more generally suggests the presence of a common mental disorder. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc598/datadownloads/downloadfamily.csv\n  [2]: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-of-children-and-young-people-in-england/2017/2017\n  [3]: https://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/policy/breakthrough-britain/family-breakdown\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc598/datadownloads/downloadmental.csv\n  [5]: https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2017/nov/teenage-depression-linked-fathers-depression\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc598/datadownloads/downloadbenefit.csv\n  [7]: https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/a-to-z/c/children-and-young-people\n  [8]: https://www.childrenssociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/poor_mental_health_report.pdf\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc598/datadownloads/downloadmarital.csv\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc598/datadownloads/downloadqual.csv\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc598/datadownloads/overall.xlsx\n  [12]: https://youngminds.org.uk/\n  [13]: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-0606.1983.tb01497.x\n  [14]: https://www.gl-assessment.co.uk/products/general-health-questionnaire-ghq/"

      "markdown": "People living on their own spend an average of 92% of their disposable income, compared with two-adult households who spend only 83% of theirs, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis of the expenditure of 25- to 64-year-olds.\n\nPeople living alone are more likely to be renting, and feel less financially secure than couples without children, with fewer reporting they have money left over at the end of the week or month.\n\nAnd the costs are not just financial: when it comes to well-being, those living on their own report lower levels of happiness and higher levels of anxiety than those living together with a partner and no children^1^.\n\n###Living alone set to increase\n\nMore and more of us in the UK [are living alone][1]. The number of people living on their own went up by 16% to 7.7 million between 1997 and 2017, while [the UK population increased by only 13%][2]. By 2039, the number of one-person households is projected to rise to 10.7 million^2^.\n\nThe rise in the number of people living alone is [largely concentrated in older age groups][3]. While the number of people aged 25 to 44 living alone has fallen by 16% between 1997 and 2017, the number of 45- to 64-year-olds living on their own has increased by 53% over the same period.\n\nThis increase is partly due to the large number of children born in the 1960s reaching this age, but may also be down to a change in our relationships: [more people in this age group are divorced or single][4] than there were 15 years ago.\n\n###Who is living alone?\nThe variation in life expectancy between the sexes – with women typically living longer than men – naturally creates more one-person households among the older population. If we concentrate on those aged 25 to 64, we can see that most of those who live alone (60%) are men. At younger age groups, this is more pronounced, but the gap between the sexes narrows as age increases.\n\n####Gap between the sexes narrows with age\n<strong>Proportions of one-person households by age and sex, UK, 2017</strong>\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc602/ownershipsex/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Gap between the sexes narrows with age Proportions of one-person households by age and sex, UK, 2017\"/>\n[Download the data][5]\n\nOf those who live on their own, people in their late 50s and early 60s are the most likely to be divorced (42% of 55- to 64-year-olds). However, more than one-third (34%) of this age group have never been married, and being single (never married) is the most common marital status for all other age groups.\n\n####Marital status varies with age\n<strong>Proportions of one-person households by marital status and age, UK, 2017</strong>\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc602/Stacked-_marital/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Marital status varies with age Proportions of one-person households by marital status and age, UK, 2017\"/>\n[Download the data][6]\n\n###People living alone less likely to own their home\nThose aged 25 to 64 who are living alone are less likely to own their home than couples without children (50% of households compared with 75% respectively in 2017), giving them less opportunity to accumulate wealth through buying their home or paying off a mortgage. We see the disparity at all age groups, and the gap in home ownership between one-person households and couples widens with age.\n\n####Those living alone less likely to be homeowners\n<strong>Proportion of households who own their home, by age and household type, UK, 2017</strong>\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc602/ownershipage/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Those living alone less likely to be homeowners Proportion of households who own their home, by age and household type, UK, 2017\"/>\n[Download the data][7]\n\n###One-person households spend more of their income on housing costs\nFor both one- and two-adult households, housing costs are the biggest expense. However, whether they rent or own their home, the burden of housing costs is greater for one-person households. People aged 25 to 64 who live alone spend a greater proportion of their disposable household income than two-adult households on rent, mortgages and other housing costs, including energy bills, water and Council Tax.\n\n####People living alone spend more on housing costs than those who live with another adult\n<strong>Proportion of household disposable income spent on housing costs, by household type, household reference persons aged 25 to 64 years, UK, financial year ending 2018</strong>\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc602/housing_cost2/chart1/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"People living alone spend more on housing costs than those who live with another adult Proportion of household disposable income spent on housing costs, by household type, household reference persons aged 25 to 64 years, UK, financial year ending 2018\"/>\n[Download the data][8]\n\n###Two-adult households spend more on recreation and transport\nAside from housing costs, people living on their own spend a greater proportion of their income on food and drink and furnishing their home. But they spend less than two-adult households on clothes, transport and leisure activities (recreation, restaurants and hotels).\n\n####One-person households spend more on food and furnishings\n<strong>Proportions of disposable income spent on selected goods and services, by household type, household reference persons aged 25 to 64 years, UK, financial year ending 2018</strong>\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc602/Other%20expenditure%20chart/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"One-person households spend more on food and furnishings Proportions of disposable income spent on selected goods and services, by household type, household reference persons aged 25 to 64 years, UK, financial year ending 2018\"/>\n[Download the data][9]\n\nPerhaps as a result of spending more of their income on housing costs, bills and food, those who live on their own are among the least financially secure household types. Around half (51%) of those who live alone say they always or mostly have money left over at the end of the week or month, compared with nearly two-thirds (64%) of those who live with their partner. The financial costs of living independently may explain why the number of younger people (aged 25 to 44) living alone is falling.\n\nPeople living on their own may find it harder to build up savings. Of those living alone, 35% say they would not be able to make ends meet for more than a month, compared with 14% of couples without children.\n\n###Living alone and personal well-being\nThe costs of living alone are not just financial. It appears that on all four measures, one-person households have the lowest well-being of all household types. When measuring personal well-being, people are asked four questions:\n<ul><li>\n“Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?”</li>\n<li>“Overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile?”</li>\n<li>“Overall, how happy did you feel yesterday?”</li>\n<li>“Overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday?”</li></ul>\n\n####Well-being lowest for those who live alone\n<strong>Average ratings of personal well-being (out of 10) by household type for people aged 25 to 64 years, UK, 2017</strong>\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc602/Wellbeing/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Well-being lowest for those who live alone Average ratings of personal well-being (out of 10) by household type for people aged 25 to 64 years, UK, 2017\"/>\n[Download the data][10]\n\nWhile this may paint a negative picture for those living on their own, it is not clear that people’s living arrangements are directly associated with their personal well-being. It may be that some of characteristics that tend to go with living alone, like being divorced, or renting your home, may have more of an impact – as [we have observed before][11].\n\n<strong>Notes:</strong>\n\n1.

      "markdown": "While earlier diagnoses lead to better outcomes for cancer patients, some cancers are relatively asymptomatic which means they may not present with significant symptoms until the disease progresses, leading to patients going to the doctor later and consequently being diagnosed at later stages.\n\nTypically, prostate cancer and breast cancer present specific symptoms (difficulty urinating, for prostate cancer, and a lump in the breast for breast cancer) which are well-publicised and lead people to seek health interventions. Additionally, these parts of the body are not considered vital organs and tumours can be removed relatively safely.\n\nWith other cancers this is not always the case. For instance, one symptom for colorectal cancer presents as stomach pain and discomfort, which could be applicable to any number of other conditions. Lung cancer (overall 5-year net survival of 15.3%) begins with a persistent cough and shortness of breath, which people may live with for a while before visiting a GP.\n\nIn the absence of obvious symptoms other conditions are ruled out first, during which time the cancer may have progressed to further stages. The government set a target in [the Department for Health and Social Care's \"Prevention is better than a cure\" report][1] for 75% of stageable tumours to be diagnosed by stage 1 or stage 2 by 2028.\n\nThis new data helps us understand more about how the stage of diagnosis affects health outcomes. It provides evidence for where health intervention resources should be concentrated and could help the government reach that target.\n\n\n  [1]: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/753688/Prevention_is_better_than_cure_5-11.pdf"

In fact, they feel a greater sense of belonging now compared with a few years ago, while levels of trust and local area satisfaction remain unchanged.\n\nThe next part of our quiz looks at how people engage with their community.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc663/ch4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"YP2: do civic activities\"/>\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc663/ch5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"YP2: can influence decisions\"/>\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc663/ch6/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"YP2: participate in volunteering\"/>\n\nUsing these measures, it’s clear that young people are as likely to participate in their local community as the rest of the population.\n\nBut, despite seeing an improvement since 2013 to 2014, young people are less likely to say they belong to their neighbourhood than older adults.\n\nThis could be linked to the fact that young people are more likely to report feelings of loneliness. According to the [most recent Community Life Survey (PDF, 725KB)][3], 8% of 16- to 24-year-olds living in England felt lonely “often” or “always” in 2017 to 2018, compared with 5% of those aged 25 and over^2^.\n\n[Research by King’s College London][4] has investigated the possible link between young people’s loneliness and neighbourhood belonging. Their study – based on a sample of 18-year-olds living in the UK – found that “feeling lonely could put a negative bias on people’s subjective perceptions of their local area”, leading them to “miss out on opportunities to connect with people around them”.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/datasets/internetaccesshouseholdsandindividualsreferencetables\n  [2]: https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0022/117256/CMR-2018-narrative-report.pdf\n  [3]: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/734726/Community_Life_Survey_2017-18_statistical_bulletin.pdf\n  [4]: https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/no-such-thing-as-friendly-neighbourhoods-for-lonely-young-people"

One possible explanation could be that this generation has a higher proportion of long-term heroin users with failing health and are therefore at greater risk of poisoning, according to [Public Health England][4].\n\nThere was an [upturn in the use of hard drugs such as heroin][5] (opioids) by a generation of young people in the 1980s and 1990s. As users age, the long-term consequences of prolonged drug-taking tend to be more pronounced as the body loses resilience and users start dying. Opioids contributed to [53% of drug poisoning deaths][6] in England and Wales, in 2017. \n\nIn its [blog, Public Health England][7] said: “40-49 year olds have the highest rate of drug misuse deaths but rates have fallen in all age groups except the very oldest (50-69 and 70+), perhaps further supporting the idea of an ageing cohort at greatest risk of overdose [poisoning] death.”\n\nA similar age pattern can be seen for deaths caused by suicide. In 2017, 49 was the age at which most people died by suicide, whereas back in 1993 this age was 22. \n\n####The age at which most people are dying by suicide has increased over time \n#####Number of suicides by single year of age, England and Wales, deaths registered between 1981 and 2017\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc661/suicides/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The age at which most people are dying by suicide has increased over time\"/>\n\n\n1.

Drug-related deaths that are classified as self-poisoning (either intentional and undetermined intent) are also included in these figures.\n3. Figures are for deaths registered, rather than for deaths occurring in each calendar year.\n4. Figures for England and Wales include deaths of non-residents.\n5. Findings are similar when looking at age-specific rates, which account for the size of the population.\n\n[download the data][8]\n\nThis apparent generational shift in suicides can be seen to begin in the late 1980s.\n\nIn the early 1980s, people in their 50s and 60s died by suicide in higher numbers than those in other age groups. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, most suicides occurred among people in their 20s, and in recent years, among those in their 40s and 50s. \n\n###Deprivation\n\nPrevious research has shown that financial instability and poverty can increase suicide risk. Changes in male suicide rates in Europe from 1981 to 2011 have previously been linked to [unemployment and indebtedness][9], with some studies showing  [suicide rates to be almost four times higher among the long-term unemployed.][10] Similar risk factors have also been [identified for drug poisoning deaths.][11]\n\n<ons-chart path=\"b8ff78af\" />\n\nFor some age groups in England, suicide rates were as much as double or more in the most deprived neighbourhoods, compared to the most affluent.\n\nThe difference in the rates at which the most and least deprived people died by suicide was most evident in the 40s and 50s age groups, but with drug deaths this difference was much larger.\n\nWith drug deaths, we see relatively few people affected in the least deprived areas, whereas the most deprived saw many times these numbers of deaths, especially in the middle-age groups. \n\n\n<ons-chart path=\"b409bf05\" />\n\n\n###Where to go for help\nIf you are struggling to cope, please call Samaritans free on 116 123 (UK and Ireland), email [jo@samaritans.org][12], or visit the [Samaritans website][13] to find details of the nearest branch.

Renewable energy consumption is also monitored as part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically under [indicator 7.2.1][2]. ^2^, ^3^     \n\n####Renewable energy made up more than 10% of the UK’s total energy consumption in 2017 \n#####Proportion of total energy consumption, by source, UK, 2010 to 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc677/chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Renewable energy made up more than 10% of the UKâ€™s total energy consumption in 2017\"/>\n\nThe largest source of renewable energy we consume in the UK is not from the sun or wind – it’s from Biomass, that is, organic material from plants or animals.\n\n<ons-box>\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">\n#####What is biomass?\nBiomass is a broad term covering all organic material including that from plants, trees (for example straw, crops or wood) and animals (for example poultry litter).\n\nIt is considered a renewable form of energy production as biomass growth removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stores it in the soil, plants or trees.\n\n</ons-box>\n<ons-box>\n<ons-box align=\"full\">\n#####What are the sources of renewable energy in the UK?  \nThe UK has a varied mix of renewable technologies and fuels including biomass which is a key fuel source for the decarbonisation of electricity generation and heat provision. Offshore and onshore wind, solar panels, hydroelectric and shoreline wave or tidal all contribute to UK renewable energy generation.\n\n</ons-box>\n####Almost 40% of energy consumption from renewable and waste sources is from Biomass \n#####Energy consumption from renewable and waste sources, by source, UK, 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc677/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Almost 40% of energy consumption from renewable and waste sources is from Biomass\"/>\n\n###Biomass used for electricity generation increased rapidly from the start of the decade\nThe majority of biomass energy consumption is not from people burning logs in their wood-burning stoves, instead around 60% is related to electricity generation. \n\nIn the last decade, as the UK has implemented policies aimed at reducing its greenhouse gas emissions and reducing its usage of coal, some previously coal burning power stations have converted to burning biomass to produce electricity. \n\nThe major source of biomass burnt in UK power stations are wood pellets. In the financial year ending (FYE) 2010 an estimated 0.2 million tonnes were burnt in power stations compared to an estimated 7.2 million tonnes in 2018.\n\nSince the start of the decade there has been a steady increase in the amount of wood pellets imported to the UK. In 2010, 0.6 million tonnes of wood pellets were imported, compared to 7.8 million tonnes in 2018.\n\nIn 2018, around 82% of wood pellets imported were from the United States and Canada.\n\n####7.8 million tonnes of wood pellets were imported to the UK in 2018   \n#####Imports of wood pellets, UK, 2010 to 2018\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc677/chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"7.8 million tonnes of wood pellets were imported to the UK in 2018\"/>\n\n###The impact of burning biomass for electricity generation on UK greenhouse gas emissions \n\nTotal UK greenhouse gas emissions have [fallen in the last decade][3] and the sources of greenhouse gas emissions relating to electricity production have changed as the use of renewable sources of electricity like biomass has increased. \n\nUnlike other renewable sources of electricity, the combustion of biomass is not greenhouse gas emission free. [UK government research][4] has shown that greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity generated from biomass can be lower or higher than those from fossil fuels like coal or gas depending on factors such as the type of biomass burnt and where it comes from. [Further UK government commissioned research][5] has examined how likely it is that emissions from burning biomass will be higher or lower than, for example, those from burning fossil fuels. \n\nIn 2017, greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of biomass for electricity production in UK power stations were around 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent compared to 4 million tonnes in 2010^4^. GHG emissions from the burning of coal have fallen over this same period to around 20 million tonnes in 2017. Total GHG emissions relating to electricity production have fallen from 168 million tonnes in 2010 to 93 million tonnes in 2017.  \n\nBiomass can be considered a renewable form of energy and electricity generation as its growth (e.g. of plants or trees) removes greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stores it in soil, trees and other vegetation. As such, it is argued that when managed and harvested in a sustainable way, biomass can be used to help reduce carbon emissions. \n\nCritics of the growing use of biomass for electricity generation in the UK have argued that the sourcing of large quantities of biomass in the form of wood pellets from the USA and Canada does not constitute a sustainable use of biomass given for example, the emissions associated with its transport or potential impacts on land use in these countries. \n\nBiomass, together with new technologies being developed to capture the emissions generated when it is combusted ([Carbon Capture Usage and Storage)][6], looks likely to continue to have a role in helping meet the UK’s long-term (2050) emissions targets, and helping the UK move towards net-zero emissions. \n\nEnsuring the sustainability of its use will be increasingly important as the greenhouse gas emissions and wider environmental impacts associated with it are considered on a global basis.\n\n####Greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of biomass in power stations has increased by almost 11 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from 2010 to 2017\n#####Greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of biomass, gas, coal and oil in power stations, UK, 2010 to 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc677/chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of biomass in power stations has increased by almost 11 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from 2010 to 2017\"/>\n\n####NOTES\n\n1. Energy statistics on an alternative territory basis are available to 2018 in the [Digest of UK Energy Statistics][7] (DUKES) published by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The [energy bridging table][8] published within the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Environmental Accounts shows the differences between DUKES and ONS Environmental Accounts estimates. Further information can also be found within the following [methodology article][9].\n  \n2. Sustainable Development Goals were introduced in 2015 and are a universal set of 17 Goals designed to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. [More information about SDGs][10] can be found on the UN website. The [UK data for SDGs][11] are available on the online reporting platform.\n  \n3. The UK government encourages renewable energy production through policies such as the [Renewables Obligation][12] (RO), [Contracts for Difference][13] (CfD), [Feed in tariffs][14] (FIT), [Renewable Heat Incentive][15] and the [Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation][16] (RTFO). The RO requires electricity suppliers to source a certain proportion of the electricity from renewable sources. CfD offer electricity generators long term contracts for low carbon energy, enabling a generator to invest in new schemes while limiting their risk. The FITs support those who produce renewable electricity.  The RHI supports those who use renewable heat. The RTFO requires transport fuel providers to supply a proportion of road transport fuels from renewable sources.\n\n4. In accordance with international guidelines that the Climate Change Act net zero target follows, emissions from biomass combustion are reported against this as a change in carbon stocks in the Land-Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector of the country where biomass is harvested. They are also reported as a memorandum item in the country and sector where the biomass fuel is used, but unless domestically grown are not counted in that country’s total emissions to avoid potential double counting.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-becomes-first-major-economy-to-pass-net-zero-emissions-law\n  [2]: https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/7-2-1/\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/netzeroandthedifferentofficialmeasuresoftheuksgreenhousegasemissions/2019-07-24\n  [4]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-cycle-impacts-of-biomass-electricity-in-2020\n  [5]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/use-of-high-carbon-north-american-woody-biomass-in-uk-electricity-generation\n  [6]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-carbon-capture-usage-and-storage-ccus-deployment-pathway-an-action-plan\n  [7]: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digest-of-uk-energy-statistics-dukes#2019\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/datasets/ukenvironmentalaccountsenergybridging\n  [9]: https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160106062519/http:/www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/economy/environmental-accounts/physical-flows/energy-consumption.pdf\n  [10]: https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300\n  [11]: https://sustainabledevelopment-uk.github.io/\n  [12]: https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-programmes/ro/about-ro\n  [13]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/contracts-for-difference/contract-for-difference\n  [14]: https://www.gov.uk/feed-in-tariffs\n  [15]: https://www.gov.uk/non-domestic-renewable-heat-incentive\n  [16]: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/renewable-transport-fuels-obligation"

Public parks or gardens, play spaces, playing fields, sports facilities, golf courses, allotments or community growing spaces, and religious grounds and cemeteries are included – but woodlands, heaths and other open spaces that people might use for recreation are not.\n\nWe found that properties very near public green spaces attracted a premium, and the more green space nearby, the higher that premium is.\n\n####The closer the green space, and the more there is, the higher the premium\nProperty price premium by distance from nearest publicly accessible green space and total amount of public green space accessible within 500 metres\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc691/line/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The closer the green space, and the more there is, the higher the premium Property price premium by distance from nearest publicly accessible green space and total amount of public green space accessible within 500 metres\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3]\n\nTo make sure our estimates compared like with like, the analysis took account of characteristics including:\n\n- type of property (for example detached, bungalow, flat)\n\n- number of bedrooms\n\n- area of home and garden\n\n- property period (for example, Victorian)\n\n- recent renovation and presence of original features\n\nWe also allowed for the effects of:\n\n- distance to transport facilities like railway stations and bus stops\n\n- distance to retail areas and workplaces\n\n- distance to nearby schools, and the inspection ratings of schools\n\n- air and noise pollution levels\n\n- socio-economic classification of area\n\nTo find out more about how we did our analysis, read [our methodology article][4].\n\n###Greatest premium paid for detached houses\n\nPublic green space boosts the prices of detached houses the most. These homes attract a 1.9% premium if they are within 100 metres of a public green space, but flats near green spaces are only 0.6% more expensive than those further away.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"324996b6\" />\n\n###Having a view of green space or water boosts prices even more\n\nHomebuyers value being near to green spaces – probably because they can use them for leisure activities like dog walking, sport and exercise. But having a view of green space or water raises house prices even more.\n\nUsing the property descriptions, and connecting words like “outlook”, “views” and “surrounded”, we identified urban houses and flats with views of green spaces – like parks and playing fields – or water, such as rivers, canals, lakes or the sea.\n\nIn 2016, having a view over a green space or water boosted house prices by an extra 1.8% – an average of £4,600.\n\n###Urban green spaces and house prices near you\n\nUse our interactive tool to find out the difference that public green spaces make to house prices near you.

The most recent available data about our personal and working lives show that many of the significant moments are happening later than they used to.\n\n<h3 id=\"family\">Age 31: Giving birth to a second (and last?) child</h3>\n<div id=\"timeline1\" style=\"position:relative\"></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://cdn.ons.gov.uk/vendor/pym/1.3.2/pym.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\nvar pymParent = new pym.Parent('timeline1', '/visualisations/dvc728/timeline/index.html#family', {});\n</script>\n\nAt first glance this age might seem fairly young. After all, as media coverage of celebrity mums suggests, [more women are having children at older ages][2].\n\nIn England and Wales, [fertility rates][3] for women aged 40 and over have almost doubled since 1999, and rates for women aged 35 to 39 are up by more than 50%. But despite this large increase, mothers in these age groups still only account for less than a quarter (23%) of births in England and Wales in 2018.\n\nAs we showed in our [previous Milestones article][4], the average age of first-time mums is 29. The typical gap between first and second children has shrunk over the last two decades and is now just over two years:\n\n####As average age of mothers rises, the gap between first and second children is shrinking\n#####Standardised mean age of mother by birth order, England and Wales, 1999 to 2018\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc728/age31noofchildren1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"age 31 number of children 1\"/>\n\nNote:\n\n1. The mean age of mother at childbirth is standardised. This measure eliminates the impact of any changes in the distribution of the population by age and therefore enables trends over time to be analysed.\n\n[Download the data][5]\n\nIt is likely that a second child will be many women’s last. The average number of children per woman has been falling for decades, with women in England and Wales who turned 45 in 2018 having had [an average of 1.89 children][6] – the joint-lowest number since records began. \n\nOnly a quarter (26%) of these women had given birth to three or more children, compared with 30% of women born around twenty years earlier. The number of women having no children, and those having only one child, has increased over this time, bringing the average number of children per woman down. Younger generations appear to be continuing this trend.\n\n####Women are having fewer children than earlier generations\n#####Estimated family size for women who are assumed to have completed their childbearing, by women's year of birth, England and Wales, 2018\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc728/age31noofchildren2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Number of children 2\"/>\n\n[Download the data][7]\n\nWe can’t measure the number of children men have in their lifetimes in the same way, since when births are registered, fathers are not asked whether they have any children already.  Both men and women are thought to be delaying having children, and possibly having fewer children as a result, [for several reasons][8], including:\n<li>more women remaining in full-time education\n<li>couples forming later\n<li>wanting to start a career, set up home with a partner and become more financially stable before having children\n\n<h3 id=\"earnings\">Age 41: Highest earnings for employees</h3>\n<div id=\"timeline2\" style=\"position:relative\"></div>\n<script>\n\nvar pymParent = new pym.Parent('timeline2', '/visualisations/dvc728/timeline/index.html#earnings', {});\n</script>\n\nEarnings across the age range have followed a broadly consistent pattern for decades: young people have earned the least and those between 30 and 50 have earned the most, with earnings steadily falling towards the typical age of retirement.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that individual workers’ pay necessarily goes down as they get older – it could be because higher-paid workers may be able to retire early, with the remaining older workers tending to work in lower-paid jobs. For example, [part-time jobs pay less than full-time ones][9] – even on an hourly basis.\n\nThe chart below shows the average earnings by age in 1999, 2009 and 2019. It does not show how earnings change for individuals through their careers. When making comparisons between time periods, it is worth noting that the employees in each age group will also change as people become or stop being employees, perhaps because of self-employment.\n\n####Age of highest earnings for employees has fluctuated in recent decades\n#####Median hourly earnings by single year of age, adjusted for inflation, UK, 1999, 2009 and 2019\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc728/age42peakearnings1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Highest earnings 1\"/>\n\n[Download the data][10]\n\nWithin this general trend, the specific age of the average highest-earning employees has fluctuated. In 1999, people in their mid-30s and 40s earned the most, with 47-year-olds earning the equivalent of £12.25 per hour, after taking inflation into account.\n\nIn 2019, it is 41-year-old employees who received the highest average hourly earnings, at £14.83 per hour.  There is some evidence that people’s earnings [are influenced by the year in which they join the workforce][11]. These employees are likely to have started work before the 2008 financial crisis, unlike younger workers whose pay may not have risen as fast as previous generations because of the impact of the recession.\n\nAs the workforce has become more gender-balanced, the ages of highest earnings for men and women have converged. In 1999, the ages of highest earnings were almost 20 years apart: women’s earnings were highest at 29 years, and men’s at 48 years.\n\nOur most recent data show the ages of highest earnings for men and women three years apart: women’s earnings are highest at 41 years, and men earn the most at 44 years.\n\n####Ages of highest earnings for men and women in employment are converging\n#####Median hourly earnings by single year of age and sex, adjusted for inflation, UK, 1999 and 2019\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc728/age42peakearnings2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"highest earnings\"/>\n\n[Download the data][12]\n\nOne factor in this shift could be the greater number of women in the workforce. Women entering the job market are more likely to be highly qualified than men, with [women outnumbering men on university courses since the mid-1990s][13].\n\nThe gender pay gap (the difference between women’s and men’s gross hourly earnings) is clear throughout most of the age range, especially beyond the typical age that women have children, although the overall gap has [reduced from 26.9% to 17.3% between 1999 and 2019][14].\n\nWomen are more likely than men to work in part-time jobs, which are usually [not as well paid as full-time roles][15]. Among full-time workers under 40, [the gender pay gap is close to zero][16].\n\nNevertheless, women’s and men’s highest earnings are still markedly different: in 2019, women’s highest earnings were £13.68 per hour (for those aged 41) while men’s earnings reached £16.40 per hour (for 44-year-olds).\n\n<h3 id=\"divorce\">Age 45: Getting divorced</h3>\n<div id=\"timeline3\" style=\"position:relative\"></div>\n<script>\n\nvar pymParent = new pym.Parent('timeline3', '/visualisations/dvc728/timeline/index.html#divorce', {});\n</script>\n\nOnly a minority of us are likely to experience this milestone – partly because only some people are married to begin with. 66% of men and 72% of women in England and Wales who turned 45 in 2017 [had ever been married][17].\n\nThe average age of divorce is of course heavily influenced by how old people are when they get married. As we showed in [the last Milestones article][18], the average age of marriage is continuing to rise.\n\nIn 2018, the [average (mean) age at divorce][19] for opposite-sex couples in England and Wales was 46.9 years for men and 44.5 years for women. This is more than six years higher than it was for both sexes twenty years ago.\n\n####Average age of people getting divorced continues to rise\n#####Mean age at divorce, by sex, England and Wales, 1998 to 2018\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc728/age45gettingdivorced/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Getting divorced\"/>\n\nNote:\n\n1. Marriages of same-sex couples first took place on 29 March 2014 in England and Wales. The first divorces recorded between same-sex couples were in 2015.\n\n[Download the data][20]\n\nThere is some evidence that people who get married later in life [have a lower risk of divorce][21] (PDF, 245kB); this may help to explain why the divorce rate has been coming down at the same time as average marital age has been rising.\n\nNot only are people getting married later – they are also staying married for longer. In 2018, the [median duration of marriage before divorce][22] for opposite-sex couples in England and Wales was 12.5 years, the longest duration since records began in 1963.\n\nA combination of all these factors is likely to be driving the continuing rise in the average age of people getting a divorce.\n\n####How many marriages have ended in divorce?\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc728/age45gettingdivorcedwidget/line/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"How many marriages have ended in divorce?\"/>\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Cumulative percentages add a percentage from one period to the percentage of another period to show the total percentage over a given time period.\n2. The Divorce Reform Act 1969, which came into effect on 1 January 1971, made it easier for couples to divorce upon separation.\n\n[Download the data][23]\n\nAs the average age of divorce has increased, so has the average age of remarriage for divorcees. In 2016, the mean age of remarriage for divorced men and women in the UK was 50.4 and 47.4 years respectively for opposite-sex remarriages – eight years older than it was in 1998.\n\nFor same-sex remarriages for divorced men and women, the average (mean) ages in England and Wales in 2016 were 50.5 years and 45.8 years respectively.\n\nWhen comparing milestones such as average ages of marriage and divorce, it is important to bear in mind that these are the latest data, but people getting married this year may not have the same average marriage duration or average age at divorce (should that happen). Likewise, people getting divorced today got married at a time when there was a different average age of marriage.\n\n<h3 id=\"care\">Age 57: Providing care</h3>\n<div id=\"timeline4\" style=\"position:relative\"></div>\n<script>\n\nvar pymParent = new pym.Parent('timeline4', '/visualisations/dvc728/timeline/index.html#care', {});\n</script>\n\nWith life expectancy in the UK [continuing to rise – albeit more slowly than before][24] – it is increasingly likely that people in their 50s, 60s and 70s will have parents or other older relatives alive who might need care.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, around 12% of the UK population provide informal (unpaid) care to family members, friends, neighbours or others because of long-term illness, disability, or problems related to old age. \n\nThe proportion of people providing care peaks at the age of 56 for women and 59 for men, at which point around one in four women (25%) and more than one in six men (18%) are informal carers.\n\n####More women than men are carers, until the age of 74\n#####Proportion of people providing care, by sex and single year of age, UK, 2011\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc728/age57providingcare1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Providing care\"/>\n\nNotes:\n\n1. The 2011 Census forms in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland asked whether respondents provided unpaid care to family members, friends, neighbours or others because of long-term physical or mental ill health or disability, or problems related to old age and for how many hours per week. It is not possible to differentiate further than an individual’s response; for this reason it cannot be guaranteed that people haven’t included general child care arrangements in their response.\n\n[Download the data][25]\n\nThe number of people who are providing care is continuing to rise: between the financial years ending 2008 and 2018, higher proportions of men aged 60 to 64 and women aged 55 to 59 years were providing informal care.\n\nInformal carers are most likely to be caring for a parent: 40% of female carers and 38% of male carers are helping their mother or father (or both). \n\nMen are more likely than women to be caring for their spouse or partner – among informal carers, around one in four men compared with around one in six women – but women are more likely to be providing care to people living in a different household.\n\n####Men are more likely than women to be caring for their partner\n#####Percentage of informal carers by sex and person cared for, UK, financial year ending 2018\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc728/age57providingcare2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Providing care 2\"/>\n\nNotes:\n\n1. These percentages have been summed from the whole number percentages in Table 5.7 of the [underlying tables][26] (.xlsx, 130kB) behind the Family Resources Survey Report 2017/18 which was published by the Department for Work and Pensions in March 2019. Constituent parts may not sum due to rounding.\n\n[Download the data][27]\n\nOverall, [women take on a greater share of informal care than men][28]. This may be due to traditional perceptions of gender roles in society, or the gender pay gap making it more financially advantageous for men to remain working while women provide care. It could be that as women are more likely than men to work part-time, they are available to provide care – or alternatively, they might be working part-time because of their caring responsibilities.\n\nFrom the age of 74 onwards, the proportion of men providing unpaid care is greater than for women. This may be because women in this age group are more likely than men to be widowed, so they no longer have a spouse to care for, and by this age, their parents are likely to have died.\n\nBy contrast, men in this age group are likely to be caring for their (typically younger) spouse or partner. In addition, healthy life expectancy (how long people live in good health) has continued to increase for men, while slightly decreasing for women. Married or cohabiting men may be looking after their spouses and partners for longer periods of time than before.\n\n<h3 id=\"grandparent\">Age 63: Becoming a grandparent</h3>\n<div id=\"timeline5\" style=\"position:relative\"></div>\n<script>\n\nvar pymParent = new pym.Parent('timeline5', '/visualisations/dvc728/timeline/index.html#grandparent', {});\n</script>\n\nSome might say that becoming a grandparent is one of life's happiest milestones. The average age of parenthood has been rising for a long time and the knock-on effect on the average age of grandparents is becoming clear: in 2017 to 2018, the age at which 50% of people had a grandchild living outside their household was 63 – three years later than 2009 to 2010.\n\n####People are becoming grandparents at older ages than before\n#####Percentage of people who have a grandchild living outside of the household by age, UK, 2009 to 2010 and 2017 to 2018\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc728/age63grandparent/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Age 63 - grandparents\"/>\n\nNote:\n\n1. Results are based on results from the following question: \"Excluding relatives who are living in the household with you at the moment, can you tell me which of these types of relatives you have alive at the moment?\". Therefore, the analysis excludes people who are living in the same household as their grandchild(ren).\n\n[Download the data][29]\n\nMany grandparents of all ages are involved in looking after their grandchildren. In England in 2018, more than one in five families (22%) with children aged 14 and under [had a grandparent involved in providing childcare][30] (.ods, 72kB) to an estimated 1.6 million children. Since 2011, grandparents [have been able to claim National Insurance credits][31] for caring for a child under 12.\n\n<h3 id=\"stopwork\">Age 64: Stopping work</h3>\n<div id=\"timeline6\" style=\"position:relative\"></div>\n<script>\n\nvar pymParent = new pym.Parent('timeline6', '/visualisations/dvc728/timeline/index.html#stopwork', {});\n</script>\nPeople are working until later in life than they used to. Between 1999 and 2019, the average age of someone leaving the labour market increased from 61.7 years to 64.7 years, although there are differences in the ages of retirement between men and women.\n\nMen generally stop working later than women, but the gap has narrowed considerably in the last 20 years. In 1999, there were two-and-a-half years between the average ages of men and women stopping work (63.2 and 60.8 years respectively). By 2019, this had closed to a single year (65.3 and 64.3 years).\n\nAlthough women are staying in the workforce for longer than before, they remain far more likely than men to work reduced hours. At age 60, women in paid work are more likely to be part-time as opposed to full-time. For men, this doesn’t happen until age 66, when most of them have left the labour market completely.\n\n####The ages at which men and women stop work are converging\n#####Average age of exit from the labour market by sex, UK, 1999 to 2019\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc728/age65stoppingwork1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Stopping work\"/>\n\n[Download the data][32]\n\nThe convergence between the ages of men and women stopping work could be down to changes to the State Pension age, which equalised at 65 for both sexes in November 2018.\n \nThe State Pension age is set to rise further, with working lives extending in response to the [UK’s ageing population][33]. Under current legislation, it will [reach 68 for both men and women][34] by 2046.\n\n####The age at which women are most likely to leave the labour market has risen in line with State Pension age\n#####Proportion leaving the labour market by sex and age, UK, April to June 2012 to April to June 2018\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc728/age65stoppingwork2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Stopping work\"/>\n\n[Download the data][35]\n\n<h3 id=\"happiness\">Ages 65 to 74: Peak happiness</h3>\n<div id=\"timeline7\" style=\"position:relative\"></div>\n<script>\n\nvar pymParent = new pym.Parent('timeline7', '/visualisations/dvc728/timeline/index.html#happiness', {});\n</script>\n\nBeyond the age at which most people have stopped working, people report some of the highest levels of happiness. Men and women in their early 60s report increasing happiness levels. Between the ages of 65 and 74, both sexes are happier than those in any other age group. \n\n####Happiness levels rise from 60 to 65\n#####Mean scores for happiness by sex and single year of age, UK, January 2016 to December 2018\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc728/age74peakhappiness/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"age 74 peak happiness\"/>\n\nNote:\n\n1. Results are based on the following question: \"How happy did you feel yesterday? Where 0 is 'not at all happy' and 10 is 'completely happy.\"\n\n[Download the data][36]\n\nWhen looking at five-year age groups, women in their 30s (aged 30 to 34 and 35 to 39) are significantly happier than men. For both sexes, happiness is lowest when they are in their late 40s and early 50s. \n \nWe have only been measuring personal well-being since 2011, so it is not yet possible to tell whether similarly high levels of happiness are likely to be experienced by people reaching this age in future, or whether the effect is confined to those currently in that age group. While the over-65s are a diverse group, the current generation [report more positively][37] on many measures of personal, social and financial well-being than their younger counterparts.\n\n###Future milestones\nIn the future, the milestones we have covered in this article and the [previous Milestones report][38] may become more, or less, important. New milestones may gain significance.\n\nThese articles have captured only selected snapshots that are common to large numbers of people, if not the whole population. For many of us, these will be supplemented or replaced by more personal milestones that we consider to be the life’s most significant events.\n\nWe would like to thank the [Centre for Population

We have obtained an estimate of exposure to disease (generally) and physical proximity for UK occupations based on US analysis of these factors^1^, using 2019 data.\n\nWhile working practices and conditions may be slightly different in the US for similar occupations, these estimates offer valuable insight into occupations that involve working in close proximity with others and those that are regularly exposed to diseases. This is a useful indication of which roles may be more likely to come into contact with people with COVID-19, based on what these roles normally entail.\n\nThere is a clear correlation between exposure to disease, and physical proximity to others across all occupations.

Three in four workers (75%) in these roles are women.

Around half (50%) of those employed as care escorts are aged 55 years or over. Workers of this age are also over-represented in occupations like ambulance staff excluding paramedics (37%), houseparents (adults responsible for children in a residential childcare establishment, usually living in the same home) and residential wardens (35%), and prison service officers (24%).\n\nOne in five workers in these occupations are from black and minority ethnic (BAME)^2^ groups, compared with 11% of the working population. These workers make up around just over a quarter of the workers who are dental practitioners (28%), medical practitioners (28%) and ophthalmic opticians (27%). Additionally, they are over-represented in four other occupations – nurses, medical radiographers, nursing auxiliaries and assistants, and medical and dental technicians.\n\nWhen it comes to pay, 6 out of 16 of these occupations have a median pay of lower than £13.21^3^, the median hourly pay across the UK. Care escorts (who accompany vulnerable people on local journeys), dental nurses, and nursing auxiliaries and assistants have the lowest median pay per hour, ranging from £9.45 to £10.93.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc806/occupations_exposure_to_disease_data.xls"

Exposure to disease and physical proximity were originally obtained using O*NET data based on US Standard Occupational Classification (SOC)  codes. \n\nO*NET ask a number of questions about individuals’ working conditions and day-to-day tasks of their job. To calculate the proximity and exposure measures, the questions asked are:\n\ni) How physically close to other people are you when you perform your current job?\n\nii) How often does your current job require that you be exposed to diseases or infection? \n\nRespondents are asked to provide a response on a scale between one and five . For the proximity question, one indicates that the respondent does not work near other people (beyond 100ft.), while five indicates that they are very close to others (near touching). For the exposure question, one indicates no exposure (never) and five indicates daily exposure. For more information on these questions, please see [Instructions for Work Context Questionnaire questions 21 and 29][1].\n\nThe responses to these questions are standardised to a scale ranging from 0 to 100 using the following equation:\n\nS = ( (O-L)/(H-L)) * 100\n\nWhere:\n\nS = standardised score\n\nO = original rating score between one and five\n\nL = lowest possible score (that is,  one)\n\nH = highest possible score (that is, five)\n\nFor example, for physical proximity, an original score (O) of four is converted to a standardised score of 75 (75 = [ [4 – 1] / [5 – 1] * 100).\n\nThe standardised physical proximity measure is defined by:\n\n0 – I do not work near other people (beyond 100 ft.)\n\n25 – I work with others but not closely (for example, private office)\n\n50 – Slightly close (for example, shared office)\n\n75 – Moderately close (at arm’s length)\n\n100 – Very close (near touching)\n\nThe standardised exposure to disease or infections measure is defined by:\n\n0 – Never\n\n25 – Once a year or more but not every month\n\n50 – Once a month or more but not every week\n\n75 – Once a week or more but not every day\n\n100 – Every day\n\n**Mapping to UK SOC codes**\n\nTo show exposure to disease and physical proximity by UK SOC codes, US SOC codes were first mapped to ISCO-08 codes and then mapped from ISCO-08 codes to UK SOC codes.\n\n**The Annual Population Survey**\n\nThis analysis uses the Annual Population Survey (APS) January to December 2019. More quality and methodology information on strengths, limitations, appropriate uses, and how the data were created is available in the [APS QMI][2].\n \nOnly respondents who said they were employed were included in this analysis.\nThe Annual Survey of Hours and Earning (ASHE) is the primary source of data for earnings analysis in the UK and therefore was used here to find median hourly pay for each SOC code. The period covered by the ASHE data is April 2019.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.onetcenter.org/dl_files/MS_Word/Work_Context.pdf\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/methodologies/annualpopulationsurveyapsqmi"

OS data show that 44% of Londoners live within a five-minute walk of a park, rising to 58% including playing fields. Both are the highest of any region or country in Great Britain.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"7ffa8e48\" />\n\nParks are most accessible in the poorest areas, with people in the most deprived neighbourhoods of England around twice as likely as those in the least deprived to be within five minutes’ walk of a public park (34% compared with 18%). Including playing fields, this rises to 57% compared with 42%.\n\nWe see similar trends in Wales and Scotland, with greater access among those living in more deprived areas.\n\nParks and playing fields could be seen as especially valuable to those without access to a private garden, but some have closed temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic with people failing to maintain social distance from one another. \n\nThe average park in Great Britain serves just under 2,000 people, although some parks in densely populated areas cater for many more. Around 46,000 people have Clapham Common as their nearest park, more than 20 times the average.\n\nThe government has published [guidance for owners and operators of public spaces in England][1].

As announced on 4 March 2021, an error occurred in the Living Cost and Food (LCF) Survey which was found to impact the Family Spending in the UK: April 2018 to March 2019 release and datasets that were the basis of this piece of analysis. \n\nThe biggest impact is on expenditure on transport (6% increase), specifically on loans or hire purchase of vehicles. To a lesser degree income (decrease of 2%) has also been affected. This has meant that although the interpretation of the statistics remains the same, the proportion of spending in each classification has been affected. We have corrected the affected values in this article. \n\nWe apologise for any inconvenience. Please contact Carla Kidd at wealth.and.assets.survey@ons.gov.uk for more information.\n\n</ons-box>\n\n<p id=\"backtotop\">More than one-fifth of usual household spending has not been possible during the lockdown, Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis reveals.</p>\n\nIn the financial year ending March 2019, UK households spent an average of £187 per week on activities that have since been largely prevented by government guidelines (such as travel, holidays and meals out). \n\nThis is equivalent to 22% of a usual weekly budget of £843, money that households could be saving, spending in other areas or using to cover any loss of income.\n\nTo estimate the potential impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) on spending, and the extent to which people might be able to cut back, we have categorised household spending from before the pandemic (based on lockdown measures introduced on 23 March 2020). There is more detail on our categories in the <a href=\"#classifications\">Spending classifications section</a>.\n\nAcross all households, more than half (53%) of usual spending covers “non-discretionary” items such as food and housing costs. We refer to this as spending on “essentials”.\n\nYounger households, those who are renting and those living in London spend a lot proportionally on essentials and relatively little on goods and services that have been unavailable under lockdown. This could limit their ability to cut back on spending if their income were to fall.\n\nTo help households under increased financial pressure, some companies – including mortgage providers and gas, electricity and water suppliers – have offered payment holidays on regular bills. \n\nWe estimate that 40% of household spending on essentials could be subject to a payment holiday, equivalent to £177 per week. \n\n####More than one-fifth of usual household spending has been prevented by the lockdown\n#####Weekly household expenditure by category, UK, financial year ending March 2019\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc824a/treemap/treemap/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Family spending treemap - dvc565\"/>\n\n#####Notes:\n\n1.

They have been less likely to receive a payment holiday on their rent, as opposed to those with a mortgage. \n\nOur data also show that spending on activities including holidays and eating out is proportionally lower among renters, potentially limiting their ability to manage housing costs alongside a loss of income.\n\n####Private renters spend more than 60% of their weekly budget on household essentials\n#####Weekly household expenditure by housing tenure, UK, financial year ending March 2019\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc824a/tenure/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Private renters spend more than 60% of their weekly budget on household essentials\"/>\n\n[Download the data][2]\n\nMeanwhile, in households where the [reference person][3] is under 30 years old, 57% of the weekly budget goes on essentials and 20% on goods and services that have been unavailable during lockdown. \n\nOn the other hand, older households where the reference person is aged between 65 and 74 years spend far less of their budget on essentials (43%) and considerably more (29%) on activities that have been prevented.\n\nWhile [evidence suggests that both the youngest and oldest workers have been hit by furloughing and job losses][4], younger households are [less likely to have enough savings to cover a loss of income][5] and less likely to be able to cut back on spending.\n\n####Older households are more able to cut back on spending during the lockdown\n#####Weekly household expenditure by age of household reference person, UK, financial year ending March 2019\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc824a/age/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Older households are more able to cut back on spending during the lockdown\"/>\n\n#####Notes:\n\n1.

      "markdown": "<h2 id=\"classifications\">Spending classifications</h2>\n\nFor the purposes of this analysis, we have categorised our household spending data into three groups.\n\n####Spending that has been prevented during lockdown\nThis covers goods and services that could not be purchased under measures introduced on 23 March 2020 (the start of lockdown), such as alcohol in a pub. It also includes spending on items where purchasing has been more difficult (such as clothing) or strongly discouraged (such as public transport). As restrictions ease, households will be able to resume spending on these items and activities. \n\n####Non-discretionary spending\nThis is spending on essential goods and services, where the consumer has little choice but to continue to buy regardless of price and income pressures. They are staple items such as food and energy payments. \n\nA separate classification has been used to define essential spending where there is evidence that payment holidays have been offered. This includes rent, mortgage payments and interest, insurance, water bills and debt repayment. We do not know how many households have been offered payment holidays, or how many have taken them up. \n\n####Discretionary spending\nThis is spending on goods and services where the consumer exercises some degree of choice over whether or not to buy and how much they spend (the price and amount purchased). Most goods and services that have been unavailable under lockdown would normally fall in this category.\n\nA full [list of goods and services assigned to each category][1] is available.\n\nPlease note that the data behind this analysis include all goods and services recorded in the Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF), including those outside the Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP). This results in a higher weekly spend (£843) than the “standard” total expenditure (£592) in our [Family Spending in the UK][2] publication. Our household spending data refer to the UK as a whole. Lockdown restrictions may vary across [England][3], [Scotland][4], [Wales][5] and [Northern Ireland][6]. \n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies has previously used ONS data to produce similar [analysis of spending by different income groups][7].\n\nMeanwhile, the ONS has used similar principles (removing unavailable items) to create [experimental series measuring price changes during the lockdown][8].\n\n<a href=\"#backtotop\">Back to the top</a>\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc824a/datadownload/household_spending.xls\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/bulletins/familyspendingintheuk/april2018tomarch2019\n  [3]: https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus\n  [4]: https://www.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19/\n  [5]: https://gov.wales/coronavirus\n  [6]: https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/campaigns/coronavirus-covid-19\n  [7]: https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14795\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/priceseconomicanalysisquarterly/may2020"

One-third (33%) also reported giving more help to people they helped previously.\n\nShopping was the most common activity that people undertook as part of their caring responsibilities (85%).\n\n<ons-chart path=\"1033464b\" />\n\n###Characteristics of people providing help or support to others in lockdown\n\nAlthough women are still more likely than men to be taking on these caring roles, with over half (51%) doing these activities, there was also a high proportion of men providing help and support to someone outside their household through April, with nearly half (45%) reporting doing so. \n\nPeople aged 45 to 54 years were most likely to report caring, with 60% of this age group reporting that they had provided help or support to someone during the first month of lockdown. The age group most likely to report caring in 2017 to 2018 was 55-to-64-year-olds (20%).\n\n###The likelihood of caring varies by age, sex, ethnicity and parental status\n\nProportion of adults providing help or support to someone outside of the household by various characteristics, UK, 2017 to 2018 and April 2020\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc899/multiple-split-bar-chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Non UK staff\"/>\n\n#####Notes:\n\n1.

This contrasts with before the pandemic, where those without dependent children were more likely to be caring for someone outside of their household (11% compared with 3%).\n\nPeople who need to balance caring for children with caring for older relatives are known as sandwich carers.  \n\nThe average age of sandwich carers, who were providing help or support for someone outside of their household and providing at least 10 hours of childcare or home-schooling per week during April 2020, was 40 years old and almost two thirds were women. 85% were employed although 17% reported working fewer hours because of childcare or informal caring responsibilities during lockdown. \n\nMost sandwich carers have been providing more help to the same people (45%), help someone who they did not previously (35%) or have been providing the same amount of help or support to someone during lockdown (21%).\n\n###Changes in the reporting of poor mental health \nSimilar levels of people reported poor mental health regardless of whether they provided help or support to others outside their home in both 2017 to 2018 and April 2020. \n\nIn 2017 to 2018, just over 1 in 5 (21%) adults that provided some regular service or help for a sick, disabled or elderly person not living with them reported symptoms of poor mental health. During April this year, among those that provided help or support to others outside their home, this increased to nearly 1 in 3 (31%). For people not providing help or support, the proportion reporting poor mental health also increased from 20% to 29%.\n\nWomen tend to report higher levels of poor mental health than men regardless of whether they have been providing support for others or not. However, there has been the largest change in reported levels of poor mental health between women who were providing support in 2017 to 2018 and women who were providing support in April 2020.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"cf64d566\" /> \n\n###Those who provided help and support more likely to feel they are playing a useful role\n\nIn a similar trend to the [wider population][2], there has not been a significant increase in reported feelings of chronic loneliness among those that provide help and support to others. Around 1 in 12 (8%) providing help or support reported feeling lonely often or always, which is the same proportion as in 2017 to 2018. \n\nDuring the first month of lockdown, around 1 in 6 (16%) of those who had provided help or support to others outside their home felt they played a useful role more so than usual, compared with just under 1 in 10 (9%) of those who had not. A higher proportion also reported that they enjoyed their day to day activities more so than usual compared with non-carers (11% and 8% respectively). \n\nHowever, the proportion of those providing help and support that reported feeling constantly under strain and losing sleep more or much more than usual is significantly higher than that reported by those who were not. Although it should be noted that there may be many reasons for these feelings, and they may not be attributable to providing the help and support. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"80c65b00\" />\n\nWhen asked about their well-being, over half of sandwich carers (52%) reported that they enjoyed their day to day activities more or the same as usual. \n\nAround half (48%) of sandwich carers however, also reported feeling constantly under strain more than usual, 38% reported their concentration was less or much less than usual and 38% of sandwich carers reported loss of sleep more or much more than usual during April 2020.\n\n###Shielding and lockdown measures have prevented some people providing care to others\n\nThere are many reasons why more people are providing help and support to others through the pandemic. The ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey has been collecting people’s experiences from the start of lockdown.\n\nBetween 3 April and 10 May 2020, 79% of adults said they were very or somewhat worried about the effect that coronavirus (COVID-19) was having on their life and 11% of these said their caring responsibilities had been affected by the pandemic. \n\nAlmost half (47%) who said their caring responsibilities had been affected said they were unable to care for someone they usually supported, for example, by being unable to spend as much time as they would like with them or being unable to travel to them. Nearly 15% also said they had to organise remote support for someone vulnerable and 9% said that paid support had reduced.\n\n###Carers who look after people they live with have also been affected by the pandemic\nBetween 3 April and 10 May, 10% of adults said they were providing care to someone they lived with who was sick, disabled or aged over 70 years. \n\nFor these carers, 84% said they were very or somewhat worried about the effect that coronavirus (COVID-19) was having on their life compared to 78% of non-carers. However, amongst those who were very or somewhat worried, similar proportions of carers and non-carers said their well-being was affected because of the coronavirus (COVID-19): 47% compared with 45%. However, there were differences in some of the most common issues causing an effect on well-being between the two groups. \n\nFor carers and non-carers, the most common reasons were feeling worried about the future, feeling stressed or anxious or being bored. However, carers were more likely to say there was a strain on their personal relationships, their mental health was worse, or they did not have anyone to talk to about their worries. \n\nThey did report loneliness and spending too much time alone less often than non-carers. Again, there may be many factors resulting in these feelings and it may not be directly attributable to the caring role.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"73df8d09\" />\n\n###Coping strategies\n\nDuring lockdown, people who reported caring for someone living with them who is sick, disabled or aged over 70 years were similar to those who are not in terms of what they are doing to help them cope while being at home. Carers were most likely to report that their family and friends (76%) are helping them to cope as well as their household members (58%), watching films or using streaming services (55%) and exercising (51%).\n\n<ons-chart path=\"878aea62\" />\n\n#####Data and methodology:\nAll sections other than the final three use data from the [Understanding Society COVID-19 Study (April 2020)][6] and [Understanding Society Main Study (2017 to 2018)][7]\n\nInformation on quality and methodology for these data are available through the links above.\n\nThe Understanding Society COVID-19 Study asks respondents whether they had provided help or support to family, friends or neighbours that do not live in the same house or flat.\n\nUnderstanding Society 2017 to 2018 asks respondents whether they had provided some regular service or help for a sick, disabled, or elderly person not living with them.\n\nThe final three sections use data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey collected between 3 April and 10 May 2020 (inclusive). This is a pooled dataset using 5 waves of data with a sample of approximately 6,400 adults (64% response rate). More details on the quality and methodology of the OPN can be found in the [Measuring the data][8] section of [Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain.][9]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc899/multiple-split-bar-chart/datadownload.xlsx\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandlonelinessgreatbritain/latest\n  [3]: https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/research/themes/covid-19\n  [4]: https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/documentation/mainstage/technical-reports\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/methodologies/opinionsandlifestylesurveyqmi\n  [6]: https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/research/themes/covid-19\n  [7]: https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/documentation/mainstage/technical-reports\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/3july2020#measuring-the-data\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/3july2020"

The map used in the tool will contain the most recent local authorities, but some of the datasets included may relate to older boundary configurations. Where this is the case, data will be unavailable for the area but can still be downloaded from the ONS website using the old boundary labels.\n\n2018-based projections data for Welsh local authorities are currently unavailable. These data will be added to the tool once projections are published on the StatsWales website. For more information, please visit [Wales national population projections][2].\n\nThe [life expectancies at birth and at age 65 years presented](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/bulletins/lifeexpectancyforlocalareasoftheuk/between2001to2003and2017to2019) are calculated from five-year abridged life tables, rather than complete (single year of age) life tables. This is because the death counts at local authority level can be too sparse for examining mortality for single years of age, and mid-year population estimates are not available or sufficiently reliable to produce rates of death by single year of age.\n\nThe life expectancies for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are also calculated from five-year abridged life tables to enable a direct comparison with local life expectancies. These differ slightly to the life expectancies produced in the [national life tables](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/bulletins/nationallifetablesunitedkingdom/2017to2019), which are calculated from complete life tables. This is because of the assumption that the probability of an individual dying is evenly distributed across each five-year age group.

      "markdown": "Employees in higher-paying jobs are more likely to be able to work from home, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis of how adaptable jobs are to remote working.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, many employees have been unable to work because of restrictions imposed to control COVID-19. But in April 2020, in the middle of lockdown, [nearly half (47%) of people in employment did at least some of their work from home][1].\n\nUsing data from a [United States (US) survey of characteristics][2] of different jobs (carried out before the pandemic), we can identify five factors that are associated with being less able to work from home. These are:\n\n- whether the job has to be carried out in a specific location\n- amount of face-to-face interaction with others\n- exposure to burns, infections and other hazards\n- whether the job requires physical activity\n- use of tools or protective equipment\n\nOne additional element – not fully reflected by the US survey data and therefore in these factors – that increases the likelihood of working from home is the extent to which digital communication is integrated into the workplace, and whether employees have the technology they need to work from home. This was explored in [Technology intensity and homeworking in the UK][3].\n\nWhile there are some differences in working practices between the US and the UK, combining these factors and applying them to the UK workforce allows us to estimate how likely it is to be able to work from home in different occupations.\n\n###Workers who earn more tend to work in jobs with more scope for home working\n\nEmployees who earn higher hourly wages are more likely to be able to work from home.\n\nChief executives and senior officials, whose median earnings are £44.08 an hour, are among those most able to work remotely, as are financial managers and directors (£31.38) and programmers and software development professionals (£21.97).\n\nGardeners, whose median hourly earnings are £10.27, are very unlikely to be able to work from home, as are carpenters and joiners (£13.18) and elementary construction occupations such as labourers (£10.25).\n\nThe median earnings of employees in the 20% of the workforce most likely to be able to work from home is £19.01, compared with £11.28 for workers in the 20% of workers in jobs least likely to be adaptable to home working. \n\n####Jobs that pay higher hourly wages are more likely to be adaptable to working from home\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc890/chart1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Jobs that pay higher hourly wages are more likely to be adaptable to working from home\"/>\n\n###Frontline workers among least likely to work from home\n\nAccording to our analysis, professional occupations such as actuaries, economists and statisticians are most likely to be able to be done from home. Jobs like these, alongside management, technical and administrative jobs, involve relatively little face-to-face contact, physical activity or use of tools or equipment.\n\nBy contrast, elementary occupations (including cleaners, waiting staff and security guards) together with process, plant and machine operatives, are much less likely to be able to work remotely.\n\nAmong the jobs least likely to be able to work from home are also frontline workers, many of which have been designated as “key workers” during the coronavirus pandemic. These include police officers, paramedics, and – scoring lowest on the scale – firefighters.\n\n####Professional occupations are most likely to be adaptable to home working\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc890/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Professional occupations are most likely to be adaptable to home working\"/> \n\nAmong the jobs least likely to be able to be carried out from home, the main factor contributing to the score was the use of tools and specialist equipment. The exposure and physical activities factors generally also contributed more than  location and interaction intensity.   \n\n###Workers least likely to be able to work from home are mostly men\n\nThe top 20% of workers most likely to be able to work from home are fairly representative of the gender split in the workforce as a whole: 49% are women.\n\nOn the other hand, the fifth of workers least likely to be able to work from home are mostly men: 75% of workers in these jobs are men, compared with 48% of the whole workforce.\n\nOnly 12 of the 103 jobs in this group have a majority of women in them (including police community support officers, vets and radiographers). Many of the rest are dominated by men: for example, only 1% of plumbers, carpenters and joiners are women.\n\n####Workers least able to work from home are mostly men\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc890/chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Workers least able to work from home are mostly men\"/>\n\n###Jobs in London and the South East are more likely to be able to be carried out from home\n\nJobs based in workplaces in London and the South East are much more likely to be possible to do from home compared with the rest of the UK, probably due to a higher proportion of professional occupations in the region. [Recent analysis][4] showed over 50% of workers with a workplace in Inner London commuted by rail or underground compared with 16% of workers working in Outer London and even fewer elsewhere.\n\nThe high concentration of finance and IT jobs in London is probably the cause of this disparity.\n\n###Ethnicity and home working \n\nDue to small sample sizes in certain occupations, it is not possible to identify clear trends between workers’ ethnicity and jobs with the ability to work from home. Based on this scale, which analyses the characteristics of an occupation that might make a job easy or difficult to adapt to home working, no significant trends were revealed. \n\nWhen looking at the fifth of the workforce in jobs with the most ability to work from home, workers from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds were very marginally overrepresented. Around 12% of workers in this group are from ethnic minority backgrounds, compared with nearly 11% of the working population as a whole. In the fifth of the workforce whose jobs were least adaptable to home working, just 9% are from ethnic minority backgrounds. \n\n###Coronavirus: how many people are working from home?\n\n[Data from before the pandemic][5] show that 1.7 million people (around 5% of the workforce) in the UK reported working mainly from home in 2019. A further 8.7 million people (27%) said they worked from home at least once in their current primary job, and 2.9 million people (9%) worked either in the same grounds or buildings as their home or used home as a base.\n\nThe lockdown changed this radically: surveyed [between 8 and 12 July 2020][6], just over a quarter of adults (27%) worked exclusively at home in the previous week – a slight decrease from 30% of adults surveyed the week prior as restrictions continued to ease.\n\n#####Notes\n\n<ol><li>Please note the ability to homework score was calculated by O*NET prior to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, therefore will not reflect any changes to working practices implemented since the outbreak.</li>\n<li>This measure of pay comes from the 2019 Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE). It is hourly earnings excluding overtime. It's calculated as gross pay /basic paid hours. The pay period in question was not affected by absence.

Data are for the period April 2019 to March 2020</li>\n<li>For the percentage of women in each occupation, figures have been grouped together for percentages greater than 95% for disclosure reasons</li></ol>\n\n##Quality and methodology\n\nThe data used to define the ability to work from home was obtained from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), which contains information about the features and the nature of the work of the US. This includes the technology and tools that are employed, and tasks performed in different jobs roles, as well as the traits of workers in those occupations. \n\nTwo O*NET datasets, the Content Model Work Activity data and the Content Model Work Context data, were used in this method. The data allotted different occupations a score of between one and five to reflect the frequency and importance of different tasks and characteristics to various jobs. \n\nFor this work, variables from both databases were selected and assigned one of five categories: \n\n- exposure\n- interaction intensity\n- location\n- physical activities\n- tools or protective equipment. \n\nFor every US occupation, a score for each category is calculated by summing the variable scores within each category.\n\nThe category scores are rescaled to between 0 and 1 to account for the different number of variables within each category using the following equation:\n\n*S = (O-L)/(H-L)*\n\n*Where:\nS = rescaled score\nO = original rating score between one and five\nL = lowest possible score within the category\nH = highest possible score within the category*\n\nThe overall ability to homework score is calculated as the sum of the five rescaled category values.\n\nThe higher the score, the less likely an occupation is to be performed from home.\n\n###Mapping to UK SOC codes\n\nTo show exposure to disease and physical proximity by UK Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes, US SOC codes were first mapped to ISCO-08 codes and then mapped from ISCO-08 codes to UK SOC codes.\n\n###Annual Population Survey\n\nThis analysis uses the Annual Population Survey (APS) April 2019 to March 2020. More quality and methodology information on strengths, limitations, appropriate uses, and how the data were created is available in the [APS Quality and methodology information report][7] (QMI).\n\n###Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings\n\nOnly respondents who said they were employed were included in this analysis. The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) is the primary source of data for earnings analysis in the UK and therefore was used here to find median hourly pay for each SOC code. The period covered by the ASHE data is April 2019. More quality and methodology information on strengths, limitations, appropriate uses, and how the data were created is available in the [ASHE Quality and methodology information report][8] (QMI).\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/coronavirusandhomeworkingintheuk/april2020\n  [2]: https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html#individual-files\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/technologyintensityandhomeworkingintheuk/2020-05-01\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/coronavirusandtraveltowork/june2020\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/coronavirusandhomeworkingintheuklabourmarket/2019\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronavirustheukeconomyandsocietyfasterindicators/16july2020#social-impacts-of-the-coronavirus-on-great-britain\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/methodologies/annualpopulationsurveyapsqmi\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/methodologies/annualsurveyofhoursandearningslowpayandannualsurveyofhoursandearningspensionresultsqmi"

      "markdown": "Lockdown in the UK has presented challenges for families whose day-to-day lives were transformed virtually overnight.\n\nAt the start of the lockdown (23 March 2020), many people had to rapidly adjust to a ‘new normal’, with school closures, parents furloughed or working from home, and support from outside the home no longer available.\n\nFor millions of parents (or those in a parenting role), this included having to care for their children, including homeschooling them, while continuing to work.\n\nA separate bulletin on [homeschooling][1] in Great Britain, offers insight into the challenges faced by those school closures.\n\n###Parents fitted in work commitments around childcare \n\nAnalysis of time use data has shown that many parents in Great Britain who were able to work, changed their routines to accommodate their new childcare commitments, prompted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown.\n\nFor working parents with school-aged children that said their work had been affected by the coronavirus, 20% said this disruption was at least in part because of having to work around childcare responsibilities. \n\nDuring the lockdown, [parents were nearly twice as likely to be furloughed (13.6%) as those without children (7.2%).][2] This is one example of the added complications for families of the restrictions.\n\nThose parents who worked outside of the home contributed childcare outside the usual ‘nine to five’ hours, which suggests that they were more likely to be working unsociable hours.\n\n####Parents have changed their weekday working patterns because of childcare commitments \n\n#####Percentage of group who were working by time of the day (weekdays only), Great Britain, 2020  \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc913/working/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Line chart\"/>\n\nParents appear to have been fitting their work around their childcare obligations, as the data shows they were more likely to work in the morning and at night.\n\nMore specifically, a larger proportion of those working delivered developmental childcare such as helping with homework in the afternoon, roughly between 3pm and 6pm.\n\n####Parents working from home delivered most childcare in the afternoon\n\n#####Percentage of group doing developmental childcare by time of day (weekdays only), Great Britain, 2020 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc913/dev-childcare/index.html\" full-width=\"false\"/>\n\n###The type of childcare that was provided changed during lockdown\n\n####During lockdown, parents spent more time on developmental childcare\n\n#####Average minutes per day spent on activity (when spread out over all days for the group), for those with a child under 18 years in the household, from 2014 to 2015 Time Use Survey compared with 2020 Time Use Survey\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc913/changeovertime/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Tie-fighter over time\"/>\n\n#####Notes:\n1. Only main activities have been included in change over time analysis.\n\nThere has been a marked change in the type of unpaid childcare provided overall, between 2015 and 2020. \n\nIn this analysis, childcare^1^ has been defined as developmental (such as helping with school work) and non-developmental (such as dressing children). \n\nThere was a 32% drop in the average time spent per day on providing non-developmental childcare, which also includes getting ready for school and going out for recreation. Between 2015 and 2020 this declined from 56 to 38 minutes a day. \n\nThis change is likely to be because daily life under lockdown was different from the norm; people were being advised to stay at home and public spaces and recreational facilities were closed.\n\nMeanwhile the amount of time devoted to developmental childcare, such as helping with homework and homeschooling, increased by 169%, from 24 to 64 minutes a day. \n\n###Women have carried out more childcare duties overall\n\nDuring the first weeks of lockdown (28 March to 26 April 2020), in households with children aged under 18 years, women were carrying out on average two-thirds more of the childcare duties per day than men.\n \nWomen were delivering an average of 3 hours and 18 minutes of childcare, which includes time spent supervising children, while men contributed 2 hours.\n\n####Women spent more time on childcare than men, with much of this focused on non-developmental childcare and supervising children\n\n#####Average minutes per day spent on activity (average time per day), Great Britain, 2020\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc913/childcare/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Clustered bar chart\"/>\n\n#####Notes\n1. All childcare includes developmental, non-developmental and supervisory childcare.\n\nThis gender difference in total provision of childcare^1^ was mostly driven by the extra time women spent in carrying out non-developmental childcare such as washing, feeding and dressing children and supervision of children. \n\nFor those with a child aged under 18 years in the household, the time women spent on non-developmental childcare eclipsed that of men by 77%. \n\nWomen carried out 53 minutes of non-developmental childcare per day whereas men contributed 30 minutes.\n\nThe time men and women spent with their children on developmental childcare^1^ (such as reading to children) was more balanced. \n\nHowever further analysis revealed that parents found developmental care more enjoyable than non-developmental care. This may provide further insight into parents’ involvement in these tasks.\n\n###Younger children received more childcare from women\n\nThe amount of childcare provided, and the extent to which women or men provided it, depended greatly on the age of the child. Generally, women supplied a larger part of the childcare time in households with younger children. \n\n####Women spent much more time on childcare than men when the child was aged under five\n\n#####Average minutes per day spent on activity spread across all days, Great Britain, 2020\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc913/ageofchild/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Tie fighter age of child\"/>\n\nIn households with a child aged under 5 years, women did on average 78% more childcare than men. \n\nPrevious analysis of time use data showed that women did more than double the proportion of cooking, childcare and housework than men. It also showed that mothers on maternity leave carried out 37 hours of active engagements with their children per week. \n\nThis may be because younger children are likely to require more ‘nurturing’ (non-developmental) childcare, such as washing, feeding and cuddling. \n\nThis gender gap narrowed to just 20% with children aged 5 to 10-years.\n\n####Parents found developmental childcare more enjoyable\n\n#####Enjoyment of time by type of activity, Great Britain, 2020\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc913/enjoyment/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Parents found developmental childcare more enjoyable\"/>\n\nOn top of extra childcare, previous time use analysis has shown that women continue to provide more unpaid work in total, including housework, which was also rated least enjoyable overall. \n\n####Women spent more time on unpaid work and less time on paid work than men\n#####Work and unpaid work by sex, average minutes per day spent on activity (when spread out over all days for the group), Great Britain, 2020\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc913/unpaidwork/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Unpaid work\"/>\n\n#####Notes\n1. Includes main activities only. \n\nBut when it came to paid work, men contributed an average of more than 45 minutes more per day than women, amounting to 2 hours and 56 minutes, compared with 2 hours and 9 minutes.\n\n###Footnotes:\n\n1. Developmental childcare: includes activities where caregivers are undertaking activities with the aim to develop a child’s cognitive development. This may include activities such as reading to children, playing with children or helping children with their school work.\n\n\tNon-developmental childcare: includes all the other tasks. These other tasks also have a welfare focus but are more concerned with physical care tasks such as feeding, washing or dressing children.\n\t\n\tAll childcare: is either developmental or non-developmental childcare, plus additional time where respondents reported being responsible for children in a supervisory capacity.\n\n2. The learning referred to in the bulletin [Coronavirus and homeschooling in Great Britain, April to June 2020][3] concerns how many hours of learning a child has done using online lessons, worksheets or other materials provided by their teachers, whetherwith their parents or not, and how both parents have felt about the experience.\n\t\n\tThe learning referred to in this release captures supervised learning, such as help with homework.\n\nWhile they address similar themes, the publications use different sources, time periods and definitions, Parenting in lockdown: this release uses the online time use survey, while [Coronavirus and homeschooling in Great Britain, April to June 2020][4] uses the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN).\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/coronavirusandhomeschoolingingreatbritainapriltojune2020\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/personalandeconomicwellbeingintheuk/june2020\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/coronavirusandhomeschoolingingreatbritainapriltojune2020\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/coronavirusandhomeschoolingingreatbritainapriltojune2020"

By the week ending 12 June (cut-off date for this analysis), this had fallen to 18%.\n\nAs the virus spread across the country and deaths became more evenly distributed, the correlation between air pollution exposure and COVID-19 mortality decreased.\n\nOur analysis includes 46,471 deaths involving COVID-19 among usual residents of England between 7 March 2020 and 12 June 2020, registered by 22 June 2020.\n\nWe considered exposure to ozone, fine particulate matter (known as PM<sub>2.5</sub>), and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and NO<sub>x</sub>.

      "markdown": "While death rates have generally been higher in polluted areas, this on its own does not establish pollution exposure as a cause of COVID-19 deaths.\n\nTo isolate the impact of air pollution, we developed a statistical model controlling for factors such as levels of deprivation, population density, public health (such as smoking rates) and pre-existing health conditions. This enables us to compare deaths among populations of similar health from the same sort of area, with the main difference being long-term exposure to air pollution.\n\nWe also controlled for ethnicity, thereby comparing deaths among populations with similar levels of ethnic diversity. \n\nOur [previous analysis][1] suggests that a range of structural differences are resulting in higher COVID-19 death rates among people of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity (BAME). Air pollution exposure could be a contributing factor if it causes COVID-19 deaths, with the BAME population more likely than those of White ethnicity to live in inner city areas (that are more polluted). \n\n####Ethnicity is strongly correlated with pollution exposure, with ethnic minorities more likely to live in polluted areas\n#####Percentage of the population of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity (BAME) compared with average 10-year exposure to NO<sub>2</sub>, selected areas in England\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc934/fig9/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Scatter plot with voronoi and zoom\"/>\n\n[Download the data][2]\n\nUltimately, our analysis is inconclusive.\n\nWithout controlling for ethnicity, we find that long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) could increase the risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19 by up to 7% (comparable with results from a [US study][3]). \n\nHowever, when controlling for ethnicity, air pollution exposure has no statistically significant impact on COVID-19 deaths.\n\nAs air pollution is just one of many factors that could be driving disproportionate outcomes for minority ethnic groups, the increased risk of dying from COVID-19 (found when ethnicity is not controlled for) is likely to be an overestimate of the true effect.\n\nA [recent study of 400 COVID-19 patients admitted to a Birmingham hospital][4] said that BAME patients were “more likely to be admitted from regions of highest air pollution, housing quality and household overcrowding deprivation”.\n\n[Our approach in this study][5] was not sufficient to pull all these factors apart. Achieving this is likely to require highly detailed individual-based modelling.\n\nIn this study, we have only been able to examine air quality and COVID-19 deaths at the population level, based on the availability of existing data. At this level, we have to make assumptions such as consistent exposure to pollution across a 1km grid square. In reality, exposure could vary from one end of a street to another, and individual exposure is affected by where someone works as well as where they live.\n\nTo disentangle factors such as pollution and ethnicity, and their contribution to COVID-19 mortality, we would need to identify detailed characteristics of the individuals who have died from COVID-19. While we hope to publish this kind of analysis in future, the data and modelling required take much longer to put together.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyethnicgroupenglandandwales/2march2020to15may2020\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc934/datadownload/fig9.xlsx\n  [3]: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054502v2\n  [4]: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-35617/v1\n  [5]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/methodologies/coronaviruscovid19relatedmortalityratesandtheeffectsofairpollutioninengland"

      "markdown": "Between March to April 2020 and September to October 2020 we have socialised more, slept less, and reverted to older patterns, such as women doing 99% more unpaid childcare than men. Our analysis shows the change in average time spent on different activities.\n\nWe asked people in Great Britain to record how they spent their time, from 28 March to 26 April 2020 and from 5 September to 11 October 2020. This captured their behaviour while experiencing the restrictions of the first lockdown and further national and local restrictions in September and October. \n\nMost of the analysis, unless stated otherwise, concentrates on activities that were the main focus of people’s day. It is compared with our most recent comparable data from before the pandemic, for 2014/2015. ^1^\n\n###Overall changes\n####On the whole, people returned to pre-lockdown behaviour in September to October 2020\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1078/overall/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"On the whole, people returned to pre-lockdown behaviour in September /to October 2020\"/>\n\n####Notes:\n\n1.\tThe activity categories are defined in our previous release, [Coronavirus and how people spent their time under lockdown: 28 March to 26 April 2020][1]. \n\n2.\tOnly times that people refer to as their main activity at any given point are shown in this chart.\n\n3.\tSome categories are not shown in this figure chart but can be found in the associated datasets.\n\n[Download the data][2]\n\nOur analysis of how people filled their time, which coincided with the first national lockdown on March 23 2020, showed some substantial lifestyle changes. But there are some areas where those transformations have been short-lived. \n\nAside from overall changes in the amount of time people spent on activities, such as working at and away from home, and travelling and transport, there were differences in the amount of sleep and rest people were getting. \n\nDuring the national lockdown, which began in March 2020, people spent an average of 9 hours and 11 minutes asleep or resting, an increase of 18 minutes on 2014 to 2015. \n\nBy September to October 2020 people had reverted to pre-pandemic habits and spent 8 hours 53 minutes sleeping or resting.  \n\nIn March to April 2020 the amount of time on any average day that people put into gardening and DIY had increased by 143%, from 16 minutes in 2014 to 2015 to 39 minutes. But by September to October 2020, possibly having completed those longstanding chores, it had dropped to 28 minutes. \n\nFollowing changes in restrictions, people spent more time with family and friends as socialising activities increased, and people spent more time working, whether at home or our normal place of work.\n\nThe amount of time that people have spent working from home has outstripped pre-pandemic levels, increasing both in March to April 2020 and further in September to October 2020 and is the main category not to move back towards those levels last seen in 2014 to 2015.\n\n###Entertainment\n####Social activities such as spending time with friends and family increased in September, whereas other less social activities decreased. \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1078/entertainment/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Social activities such as spending time with friends and family increased in September compared , whereas other less social activities decreased\"/>\n\n####Notes:\n\n1.\tThese are some of the activities that make up the “Entertainment, socialising or other free time” category, which is defined in our previous release, [Coronavirus and how people spent their time under lockdown: 28 March to 26 April 2020.][3]\n2.\tOnly times that people refer to as their main activity at any given point are shown in this chart.\n\n[Download the data][4] \n\nIn September to October 2020 people spent more time on more sociable activities - a total of 34 minutes a day socialising, spending time with friends, family, neighbours and colleagues. This compares with just 6 minutes on this activity in March to April 2020.\n\nIn the stricter conditions of the March lockdown, people recorded more time on pursuits that could be done at home.\n\nDuring those early months of the pandemic, when cafés, pubs and restaurants and entertainment venues were closed, people were doing things such as watching TV, Blu-ray or DVDs or watching streaming services. By September to October 2020, we were watching or streaming 26 minutes less, a total of 2 hours and 28 minutes.\n\n###Returning to a pre-lockdown gender gap in unpaid work\nAs people returned to work, men spent less time on unpaid household work - 18 minutes less on an average day. \nWomen, on the other hand, continued to cook, clean and perform a similar amount of household work as during lockdown; a total of two hours and 44 minutes. \n\nAs a result, the gender gap in unpaid work^2^ is shifting towards pre-lockdown levels. Women did an hour and 21 minutes (81 minutes) more unpaid work than men. \n\nThe trends in paid and unpaid work, including childcare but not travelling, resulted in women continuing to do more work in total.\n\n####The amount of time women spent on paid and unpaid work is still more than men in September to October 2020\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1078/wrapper/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The amount of time women spent on paid and unpaid work is still more than men in September to /October 2020\"/>\n\n####Notes:\n\n1.\tThe activity categories are defined in our previous release, [Coronavirus and how people spent their time under lockdown: 28 March to 26 April 2020.][5]\n\n2.\tOnly times that people refer to as their main activity at any given point are shown in this chart.\n\n3.\tSome categories are not shown in this chart but can be found in the associated datasets.\n\n[Download the data][6]\n\n###Paid and unpaid work\nSince April we have been required to change the way we balance home and work life.\n\nAs the economy and businesses started to open up and trade again, people began to return to work. There was a 20% increase in time worked on an average day in September to October 2020 since lockdown, for those in employment. \n\n####Paid employment \nIn 2014 to 2015 people in employment were only working from home for an overall average of 22 minutes per day.  By March to April 2020 this had increased to an hour and 21 minutes (81 minutes), increasing dramatically by 32% by September to October 2020 to an hour and 47 minutes (107 minutes).\n\nFor those in part-time employment, time working away from home increased more noticeably, more than doubling, from an hour and 15 minutes (75 minutes) to two hours and 32 minutes (152 minutes). On the other hand, they worked as much at home in the further national and local restrictions as they did during lockdown, at an average of 49 minutes.\n\n####Working from home\nDuring the first set of restrictions, people increased their time spent working from home, and this increased further later in the year as well.\n\nThere was a stark difference in the income levels of those who spent more time working from home and those who spent more time working outside the home. That difference only increased between March to April 2020 and September to October 2020, as people came off furlough and businesses started to re-open.\n\nThose with highest levels of household income spent more time working from home, whereas those with the lower levels of income spent more time working away from the home. \n\nMore information on trends in homeworking can be seen in [Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain: 4 December 2020][7] and [Coronavirus and homeworking in the UK: April 2020.][8] \n\n####After lockdown, those on the highest incomes switched to working from home more while those on the lowest incomes worked more outside the home\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1078/workingincome/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Those on the highest incomes switched to working from home more while those on the lowest incomes worked more outside the home, September and early October compared with lockdown\"/>\n\n####Notes:\n\n1.\tOnly working at home and away from home that people refer to as their main activity at any given point are shown in this chart.\n2.\tThe activity categories are defined in our previous release, [Coronavirus and how people spent their time under lockdown: 28 March to 26 April 2020][9].\n\n[Download the data][10]\n\n###Parents switching away from childcare and housework towards more paid work\n####Parents spent more time working in September and October 2020, and less time on unpaid childcare and household work\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1078/parents/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Parents spent more time working in September and October 2020, and less time on unpaid childcare and household work\"/>\n\n####Notes:\n\n1.\tThe activity categories are defined in our previous release, [Coronavirus and how people spent their time under lockdown: 28 March to 26 April 2020][11].\n2.\tTime that people refer to as their main, secondary or third activity at any given point are shown in this chart.\n\n[Download the data][12] \n\nAs schools re-opened, by September to October 2020, parents were doing more paid work on average (up by 54 minutes), while at the same time spent less time on childcare and unpaid housework (down by 51 minutes on average). These times were both when it was their main focus, or while multitasking with other activities.\n\nOn an average day, the increase in paid work for parents was almost fully driven by time spent working from home, showing an increase by 90% to 1 hour and 45 minutes on an average day across the week.\n\n####Footnotes:\n\n1 -  September to October 2020 and March to April 2020 periods refer to the GB population, while 2014 to 2015 period refers to the UK population.\n\n2 - Unpaid work refers to housework and childcare but not gardening/DIY or travel and the provision of transport.\n\n\n####What happened during the [national lockdown of 23 March 2020][13]?\n\n-  People were required to stay at home, except for very limited purposes.\n\n-\tCertain businesses and venues were closed.\n\n-\tAll gatherings of more than two people in public were stopped.\n\n####Coronavirus timeline up to mid-October 2020:\n\n- [23 March - First UK lockdown – (Stay at Home)][14]  \n\n- 13 May - The Prime Minister urges people who are unable to work from home to go back to their jobs, while maintaining social distancing. \n\n- 15 June – Non-essential shops reopen in England\n\n- 4 July – Social distancing restrictions eased in England: – “one-metre plus” rule as pubs, cinemas and restaurants reopen. \n\n- 1 September - Children in England Wales and Northern Ireland head back to school during this week.\n\n- 14 September - [Social gatherings of more than six people][15] are made illegal in England as the government seeks to curb the rise in coronavirus (COVID-19) cases.\n\n- 26 September – new terms start at universities around the UK.\n\n####Methodology\n\nFor methodological information relating to this publication, please see our previous release [Coronavirus and how people spent their time under lockdown: 28 March to 26 April 2020][16].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/satelliteaccounts/bulletins/coronavirusandhowpeoplespenttheirtimeunderrestrictions/28marchto26april2020#glossary\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1078/overall/datadownload.xlsx\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/satelliteaccounts/bulletins/coronavirusandhowpeoplespenttheirtimeunderrestrictions/28marchto26april2020#glossary\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1078/entertainment/datadownload.xlsx\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/satelliteaccounts/bulletins/coronavirusandhowpeoplespenttheirtimeunderrestrictions/28marchto26april2020#glossary\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1078/wrapper/datadownload.xlsx\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/latest\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/coronavirusandhomeworkingintheuk/april2020\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/satelliteaccounts/bulletins/coronavirusandhowpeoplespenttheirtimeunderrestrictions/28marchto26april2020#glossary\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1078/workingincome/datadownload.xlsx\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/satelliteaccounts/bulletins/coronavirusandhowpeoplespenttheirtimeunderrestrictions/28marchto26april2020#glossary\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1078/parents/datadownload.xlsx\n  [13]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/full-guidance-on-staying-at-home-and-away-from-others\n  [14]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/full-guidance-on-staying-at-home-and-away-from-others\n  [15]: https://www.theweek.co.uk/coronavirus/106297/what-are-the-new-coronavirus-rules\n  [16]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/satelliteaccounts/bulletins/coronavirusandhowpeoplespenttheirtimeunderrestrictions/28marchto26april2020#glossary"

We know COVID-19 mortality is higher for men than women, it is higher for older people than younger people, and people with certain health conditions such as cancer or heart disease are more at risk.\n\nAnalysis took into account other factors that could affect how exposed people are to the coronavirus, such as where people live and some social factors, like how many people live in a household.  \n\nWe can see death rates for most ethnic minorities are higher compared to White ethnic groups.

ONS figures based on death registrations up to date that occurred between 2 March and 28 July and could be linked to the 2011 Census.\n3.

Rate of death between 2 March and 28 July 2020.\n5. Other ethnic group encompasses Asian other, Black other, Arab, and other ethnic group categories in the classification.\n6. Error bars not crossing the x axis at value 1.0 denote a statistically significant difference in relative rates of death.\n\nAlthough ethnicity data related to COVID-19 mortality can be quite detailed, small sample sizes in some groups (for example Chinese) make it difficult to be sure of any differences or trends.\n\nSometimes this means we use broader groupings, such as \"Asian\", to include Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese and other Asian ethnicities. The larger sample size for \"Asian\" compared with Chinese means we can identify differences with more certainty. Similarly, \"White\" includes White British as well as White minority groups such as Gypsies and Irish Travellers and others.\n\nWhen we talk about \"ethnic minorities\" as a group in this article, we are referring to Asian, Black, Mixed and Other ethnic groups compared to White ethnic groups, unless otherwise stated. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/updatingethniccontrastsindeathsinvolvingthecoronaviruscovid19englandandwales/deathsoccurring2marchto28july2020"

Weighted data are available from Wave 7 (1 June to 14 June) onwards only. The sample redesign in Wave 7 improves our coverage for the small-sized businesses, allowing for weighted results to be truly reflective of all businesses. Comparisons between these periods should be treated with caution.\n3. Businesses were asked for their experiences for the reference period. However, for questions regarding the last two weeks, businesses may respond from the point of completion of the questionnaire.\n4. Percentages are from businesses that had not permanently stopped trading.\n\nFrom April 2020, millions of UK workers whose employers were unable to continue trading at the same levels as before the lockdown were supported by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, also known as furlough. \n\nThe ONS Business Impact of Coronavirus Survey (BICS) Wave 7 found 30% of workers across businesses that had not permanently stopped trading were on furlough leave between 1 June and 14 June 2020. \n\nWith theatres, cinemas and other venues closed, the arts, entertainment and recreation sector had furloughed 71% of workers in early June. The accommodation and food service sector – affected by the limiting of pubs and restaurants to takeaway only – had 69% of staff on furlough at the same time. \n\nThe proportion of the workforce on furlough leave gradually reduced over the summer, particularly with the re-opening of the hospitality sector, reaching 8% by Wave 16 (5 to 18 October 2020). The proportion of the workforce on furlough leave has increased to 16% in Wave 19 (16 to 29 November 2020). This is likely to be as a result of new restrictions introduced over the survey period. "

Education settings included are academies (including free schools and studio schools), local authority maintained schools (excluding local authority nursery schools), non-maintained special schools, alternative provision and university technical colleges.\n2. All figures are adjusted for non-response. This methodology has been adjusted through-out the pandemic.\n3. From March to July schools were asked to provide a count of the number of children of critical workers and the number of vulnerable children. Some children were classified as both a child of a critical worker and a vulnerable child. Some settings counted pupils as children of critical workers, but not in the count of vulnerable children. Therefore, the number of vulnerable children is an under-estimate. DfE estimates the true figure is up to 5% higher.\n4. On 25 September and 2 October, 1% of state-funded schools in England reported an inset or training day. Schools or colleges with inset or training days are considered as 'open' but not 'fully open'.\n5. From 12 October, schools were asked to exclude nursery children from their submission. A corresponding decrease was observed in submitted number on roll in schools with nurseries.\n6. [Latest data and additional footnotes and methodology can be found on the Department for Education website][1].\n\nAs the UK went into its first full lockdown in March 2020, schools sent most pupils home to learn from there. The scientific advice provided to the government at the time was that this would help to slow the spread of the coronavirus. \n\nAccording to [Department for Education data][2], in the first week of the national lockdown, 2% of students in state-funded schools in England – an average of just under 200,000 per day – were still attending. These included vulnerable children and children of key workers. \n\nBetween 7 May and 7 June 2020, 87% of parents said a [child in their household had been home-schooled][3] because of the pandemic, according to the ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey. \n\nIn June 2020, children in Reception and Year 1 and Year 6 pupils in England were able to return, followed by those in Years 10 and 12, with exams coming up. In [Wales][4], schools re-opened on 29 June, with only a third of pupils at any one time going into school, while in [Scotland][5] and [Northern Ireland][6] schools began to return in August.  \n\nSince September 2020, all students across all nations of the UK have been expected to attend school unless they had been exposed to COVID-19, were displaying symptoms or needed to be absent for other valid reasons. \n\n\n  [1]: https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/attendance-in-education-and-early-years-settings-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak\n  [2]: https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/attendance-in-education-and-early-years-settings-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/educationandchildcare/articles/coronavirusandhomeschoolingingreatbritain/apriltojune2020\n  [4]: https://gov.wales/pupils-present-maintained-schools\n  [5]: https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-daily-data-for-scotland/\n  [6]: https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/topics/statistics-and-research/management-information-relating-attendance-educational-settings-during-covid-19-outbreak"

In early September, [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) warned][1] that large numbers of students travelling for study presented a “critical risk” of seeding coronavirus outbreaks across the UK, and said universities were highly likely to experience significant outbreaks.  \n\nHowever, capturing information on the prevalence and transmission of COVID-19 among higher education (HE) students in England is difficult. The CIS does not cover those living in university halls of residence, the NHS Track and Trace programme only tests those with COVID-19 symptoms, and testing programmes run by individual universities vary in their size and scope.  \n\nWe have worked with the University of Exeter and Loughborough University to produce case studies that provide insights into what happened when their students returned to university in September. While these findings cannot be applied to all institutions, they do provide initial information that could inform the wider higher education sector.  \n\n####Cases of COVID-19 among Exeter students rose fastest the week following the start of term \n\n#####The number of positive test cases for students attending the University of Exeter by test date between 2 September and 16 November\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1113/line/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Cases of COVID-19 among Exeter students rose fastest the week following the start of term \"/>\n\n####Download the data\n<p><a class=\"btn btn--primary btn--bold\" href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1113/line/datadownload.csv\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">.csv</a></p>\n\n#####Notes\n1. This includes data from students tested via the University’s commercially-provided PCR testing and from students tested via NHS Test and Trace. \n2. Students attending the University of Exeter had wider access to COVID-19 tests than at universities without access to their own testing. This could affect the volume of cases seen on campus. \n3. A smaller number of students are typically housed in university halls, meaning the numbers of cases in this accommodation type likely represent a larger proportion of the residents  \n\nThe number of cases at Exeter rose rapidly from roughly a week after the start of term (which commenced on 21 September, with students arriving in halls of residence between September 10 and 20) to a peak of 196 cases on 30 September. From that point, total cases fell to less than 25 per day from 15 October for the rest of the period. This increase was sharper in halls of residence than in private residences. \n\n####COVID-19 spread among private student households before halls of residence \n#####The number of cases in Exeter University students by date and place of residence \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1113/exeter-map/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"COVID-19 spread among private student households before halls of residence \"/>\n\n#####Notes \n1.

This includes data from students tested via the University’s commercially- provided PCR testing and from students tested via NHS Test and Trace.  \n3. Students attending the University of Exeter had wider access to COVID-19 tests than at universities without access to their own testing. This could affect the volume of cases seen on campus.   \n4. Case counts have been suppressed where the number of daily cases in an area is lower than five  \n5. There may be some double counting for students aged 21 and over who could appear in both the NHS testing data and in the positive cases seen in private residences. \n\nThe map shows that COVID-19 cases among Exeter students initially spread in  private student households (in blue), before high numbers of cases appeared in halls of residence (in green) from late September.   \n\nTypically, students living in halls of residence at the University of Exeter are first year undergraduates, while all other students reside in private housing. As a smaller proportion of students are housed in halls, the high number of cases in this accommodation type likely represents a higher percentage of residents tested positive here compared with in private housing.   \n\nIt is likely that students living in halls share spaces with a larger number of students than those in private housing, increasing the likelihood for the virus to spread quickly. Flats in halls of residence at the University of Exeter usually accommodate between six and nine students.  \n\nThe map also shows NHS testing data for those aged 21 years and over in the general population in Exeter (in grey).

A smaller number of students are typically housed in university halls, meaning the numbers of cases in this accommodation type likely represent a larger proportion of the residents \n\nCOVID-19 cases among Loughborough University students rose during October 2020, with the cases in halls of residence rising sharply in late October. While cases peaked multiple times throughout October, they then decreased to a lower level during November.   \n\nAt Loughborough, like at Exeter, most students live in private housing, with around a third housed in halls. Therefore, the number of cases recorded in halls likely represents a higher proportion of the total population in this accommodation type compared with private housing.  \n\nHalls of residence tend to house more students in closer proximity to one another. This, coupled with the university’s ability to monitor cases more readily in this setting, are likely contributing factors to the high peak of COVID-19 cases in Loughborough halls. \n\n####Coronavirus cases among Loughborough students peaked later in October  \n#####The number of cases in Loughborough University students by date and place of residence \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1113/lboro-map/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Coronavirus cases among Loughborough students peaked later in October\"/>\n\n#####Notes \n1.

We do not yet have sufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of these different measures.  \n\nHowever, this information does show that comprehensive monitoring of infections in halls of residence is vital in fully capturing how the virus is affecting students. No comprehensive programme is yet in place to do this, but pilots by the Joint Biosecurity Centre into waste water sampling and mass testing may provide further evidence into the best way to tackling this.  \n\n"

We also worked with a selection of universities to understand more about transmission among HE students more generally.  \n\nInformation about the transmission of COVID-19 was collected by universities through a range of methods, including telephone calls with students who have tested positive and analysis of student timetables and residential information.  \n\nMost COVID-19 transmission could be traced back to students living together. Patterns often show one positive case followed by further positive cases within the same university block with quick succession (usually within a couple of days of the first case). \n\nWe found minimal evidence of transmission happening in face-to-face learning environments, such as lecture theatres. In instances when transmission was traced back to a face-to-face learning environment, further investigation showed specific reasons for it happening, usually through appropriate guidance not being followed, such as the removal of a face mask. One university described the results of their investigations of non-domestic transmission as “human compliance failures rather than systemic failures”.  \n\nAssessments into transmission of positive COVID-19 cases at the University of Reading and York St John University concluded that the majority of transmission was through domestic or social interactions (82% and 76% respectively). Neither university had evidence of direct transmission through a face-to-face learning environment. \n\nThe evidence presented here does not yet provide a comprehensive national picture about the nature and level of transmission among HE students, but provides some  insights into where and how COVID-19 transmission happens for ongoing research."

All four UK nations are publishing regular data on attendance in school but it is not possible to make direct comparisons because of differences in data collection, definitions of vulnerable children and the timing of changes to lockdown rules. \n2. Northern Ireland data are published with weekly totals whereas other nations provide daily attendance figures.\n3. Gaps in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in October and November are for half term and in all four nations for the Christmas holidays. In Scotland the data are affected by public and school holidays. In the week beginning 12 October, 29 of the 32 local authority areas were on holiday so the figures are based only on East Lothian, Edinburgh and Midlothian.\n4. Attendance during autumn term was compulsory unless pupils had an authorised absence, were ill or self-isolating.\n5. In Wales, secondary schools moved to remote learning for the last week of the autumn term, from 14 December 2020 and many primary schools did the same. Data for Wales include schools and other educational establishments.\n6. In England primary schools were open on 4 January 2021, except for some in Tier 4 restrictions or those that were on planned inset days, before a new national lockdown began that evening. Secondary school pupils were already expecting a delayed return.\n7. Following the announcement of a new lockdown in England, schools were advised they did not need to complete the Department for Education’s attendance survey between 5 and 8 January 2021 while it was updated. They began submitting data again from 11 January 2021.\n\n[Data download][1]\n\nThe return to full lockdown across the UK on 4 January 2021 saw most pupils switch once more to remote learning – with attendance at school limited to [vulnerable children and children of critical workers only][2].\n\nDuring autumn term 2020, average on-site attendance in state-funded schools in England was 86%. Following the start of the new lockdown, [attendance dropped to 13.9% in state-funded schools on 13 January][3].\n\nHowever, the percentage attending was much higher than just after the start of the first national lockdown. Between 11 and 15 May 2020, average attendance on site at state schools in England was 2.4% – including vulnerable children and children of critical workers. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that 3.2 million UK [key workers][4] have children aged between 5 and 15 years.\n\nIn Wales, 7.1% of [pupils attended school][5] on 13 January 2021. On a typical day during May and June 2020 between [1% and 1.5% of children attended schools][6] and other educational establishments in Wales. \n\nIn Scotland, [7.0% of pupils attended on 13 January 2021][7], which reduced to 6.4% on 14 January 2021.\n\nData [for Northern Ireland][8] are collected weekly rather than daily.

Between 14 and 23 December 2020, almost one-fifth of businesses that reported they were unsure how to prepare for the end of the transition period in BICS said this was because of COVID-19.  \n\nSimilar to trade data, our Quarterly Stocks Survey (QSS) – measuring the value of stocks held by UK companies – highlights stockpiling as a pattern of behaviour ahead of previous Brexit deadlines. It shows a clear peak in business stocks in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2019 and another rise in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2019. \n\nAnalysis of comments submitted as part of the QSS shows that Brexit was a consideration for businesses during 2019, with the term appearing most frequently early in the year, ahead of the March deadline.  \n\nHowever, responses from the first three quarters of 2020 show that COVID-19 has far outweighed Brexit as a factor behind changes in stock levels since then.  \n\n<ons-chart path=\"b2acac2f\" />\n\nWe await official trade and stocks statistics up to the end of the EU transition period.

In November 2020, the number of referrals had decreased by 9% (compared with November 2019). \n\nThe number of referrals to [NHS funded secondary mental health, learning disability and autism services][2] dropped by 31% in April 2020 (compared with April 2019). In contrast, in November 2020, referrals had increased by 6% (compared with November 2019). \n\nThis corresponds with a considerable fall in the number of [General Practice (GP) appointments][3] and referrals during the first lockdown in March 2020. It may indicate that fewer patients went to their GP, or that fewer referrals were made following GP appointments. However, it cannot be said with certainty at the moment that the lockdown was the reason for the fall in referrals to these services. \n\nThe extra measures taken to combat the coronavirus, such as a shift from GP face-to-face appointments to video or telephone meetings, may also be connected to the decline in the number of referrals. \n\nSince the beginning of lockdown, there has been a marked [increase in anxiety][4] in Great Britain, although there has been some improvement with anxiety levels since January 2021, as seen in [Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain: 26 February 2021.][5] Between 20 and 30 March 2020, average anxiety scores were 5.2 out of 10, an increase from 3.0 in the last quarter of 2019. By late June 2020, anxiety had decreased to 3.6 but still remained elevated compared with the end of 2019. \n\nIn addition, the proportion of people self-reporting symptoms of depression has almost doubled, according to [Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain: 11 December 2020][6]. Between July 2019 and March 2020, 10% of adults experienced moderate to severe symptoms of depression. By June 2020, this had almost doubled to 19%. By November 2020, the proportion of adults experiencing some form of depression remained at 19%, while 17% experienced some form of anxiety. \n\n\n  [1]: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/psychological-therapies-report-on-the-use-of-iapt-services\n  [2]: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-services-monthly-statistics\n  [3]: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/appointments-in-general-practice\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/coronavirusandanxietygreatbritain/3april2020to10may2020#change-in-well-being-up-to-and-during-the-pandemic\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/26february2021\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/11december2020#characteristics-of-adults-experiencing-some-form-of-depression-or-anxiety"

Between 20 January and 5 February 2021 there were more than 6,000 critical care beds open each day. Throughout January and February between 2017 and 2020, the number of critical care beds open ranged between 3,500 and just over 3,900. \n\nThe daily SitReps are submitted by acute hospital trusts every day in times of pressure on the NHS. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1214/datadownloads/fig2_occupied_beds.csv\n  [2]: https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/uec-sitrep/"

Other industries saw less significant falls. For example, in financial, insurance and real estate services, where many workers were likely to be able to do so from home, the average in April to June 2020 was down 6% on the same period of 2019.  \n\nBy October to December 2020, average weekly hours worked had increased but were still down by 7% overall on the same period of 2019, with accommodation and food services down 33% as they were affected by lockdown measures, the tier system in England and rules on the numbers of people allowed to meet indoors. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1214/datadownloads/fig3_hours_worked.csv\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/averagehoursworkedbyindustryhour03"

The 2008 to 2009 economic downturn was because of structural issues with financing mortgages. The fall in house prices in 2008 and 2009 reflects the impacts of the financial crisis on the cost and availability of finance, including for mortgages.

      "markdown": "<ons-image path=\"385eff40\" />\n\nHigh-frequency consumer spending data from Revolut provide insight into the relative impact of different UK lockdowns. With Revolut customers generally younger and more metropolitan than average with a fast-growing customer base of several million in the UK, spending may not be representative of the UK macroeconomic picture – we weight to adjust for this, alongside high user-base growth, and sectoral representation.  \n\nData from Revolut suggest that spending across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland dropped to lower levels during the spring 2020 lockdown compared with subsequent periods of restrictions. Average spending across the UK as a whole fell by 56% in the spring 2020 lockdown compared with pre-pandemic, as opposed to 17% under autumn and winter 2020 restrictions (boosted by seasonal spending) and 28% during the early 2021 lockdown. \n\nThis is consistent across various categories of spending. Compared with a pre-pandemic baseline, the drops in spending on retail (including clothing and footwear shops), entertainment (pubs, restaurants and social venues) and fuel and transport (covering personal travel spend) were substantial in autumn and winter 2020 and early 2021, although less severe than compared with spring 2020. \n\nThis matches what we have seen in levels of workplace and retail and recreation mobility, which have remained higher in more recent periods of restrictions compared with spring 2020. \n\nFood and drink (including supermarkets and convenience stores) is the only category where spending has consistently remained above or around its pre-pandemic baseline across the four nations, with only Wales seeing slightly lower levels in the early 2021 lockdown.  \n\nNotably, all nations saw food and drink spending spike amid uncertainty and panic buying in the days leading up to the spring 2020 lockdown. The spikes ahead of latter restrictions were far less significant, as consumers adjusted. "

Google mobility data have been smoothed by taking a monthly average of given index. Therefore, Indices may not start at 0. \n2. The base period is the median value from the five-week period 3 January to 6 February 2020 for the given day of the week. \n3. Please note that aggregating to monthly values averages over days of the week, each of which has a different levels of baseline mobility captured in early 2020.

Office for National Statistics (ONS) retail sales index is referenced to February 2020 = 100.\n\n[Data download][2]\n\nAcross the different lockdowns there have been various restrictions on non-essential retail stores, which had an impact on the number of people travelling to access these services.  However, much like overall economic activity, the impact of coronavirus restrictions on retail sales has lessened since the spring 2020 lockdown. \n\nTotal sales values dropped to 6.5% below their pre-pandemic level in January 2021, a far cry from the 23.3% fall in April 2020.  \n\nThis reduced impact is partly down to an acceleration in the long-term shift by consumers towards online shopping. The value of online retail sales has increased markedly, largely offsetting the fall in in-store sales. \n\n[Feedback from online retailers][3] suggests that non-essential store closures have helped boost sales. As a result, the share of online retail sales rose to a record 35.2% in January 2021, up from 19.5% a year earlier in January 2020 and 34.1% in May 2020. \n\nThe rise of online sales as a percentage of all retail has been consistent across sub-sectors, including food stores, that were able to remain open. With the help of click and collect services, the proportion of online food sales increased from 5.3% in February 2020 to 12.2% in January 2021.  \n\nAnd this could be a culture shift: according to our recent [Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN)][4], 21% of adults plan to continue doing more of their grocery shopping online once the pandemic is over than did so before, which rises to 33% for people shopping online for other things. \n\n####All store types have seen an increase in online as a percentage of total sales \n#####Online retail sales proportions by sector, seasonally adjusted, Great Britain, January 2020 to January 2021 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1245/RSI-proportion_by_sector/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Online retail sales proportions by sector, seasonally adjusted, Great Britain, index 2016=100\"/>\n\n[Data download][5]\n\n\n  [1]: https://support.google.com/covid19-mobility/answer/9824897?hl=en&ref_topic=9822927\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1245/RSI-instore_vs_online/wrapper/datadownload.csv\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/bulletins/retailsales/january2021\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain19march2021\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1245/RSI-proportion_by_sector/datadownload.csv"

For example, for those aged 16 to 24 years, holding a degree or equivalent increased the likelihood of returning to employment by 30.5  percentage points on average, compared with those holding GCSEs or equivalent.\n\nAdditionally, those in this group who had changed qualification level whilst being out of work were significantly more likely to return to or enter employment than those who hadn’t gained new qualifications.\n\nEven though young people in general were more likely to return to work, we know from [past research][3] that younger age groups will be affected by a period of being out of work in later life in other ways, such as negative lower future earnings. \n\nOther findings for young people can be seen in our [associated data tables][4].  \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/uncertaintyandhowwemeasureit#confidence-interval\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1269/age/datadownload.xlsx\n  [3]: https://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/cmpo/migrated/documents/wp97.pdf\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/unemploymentscarringwhataffectsapersonschancesoffindingajobfollowingaperiodoutofwork"

This was more pronounced among people who previously worked in the hospitality sector, and among people of Asian ethnicity.\n\nThe demographics of different regions also probably affected the rates at which people returned to work. \n\nFor example, people in Northern Ireland who were out of work were more likely to hold no qualifications (25.0%) and less likely to hold degrees (9.5%) compared with the UK population.\n\nAdditionally, more than half of people out of work in Wales were disabled, which was higher than other regions and countries in the UK.

We can then see how these proportions differ by different characteristics, such as age or ethnicity. \n\nWe measured whether people who were out of a job in a particular period  had returned to employment in the next period. For our LFS analysis, the next period was one quarter later, while for the USoc data, it was one year later. \n\nIn order to understand the influence of any personal characteristic in isolation, we have used a model to control for other variables, called a fixed effects logistical regression. This shows the effect of individual characteristics on people’s likelihood of returning to work, in comparison with a reference group. \n\nFor this, we pooled all the LFS data from 2007 to 2020, which means our model refers to people who had been out of work any time between these periods. It is important to note the fluctuating labour market conditions during this time period which include times of recession and economic recovery. The same process was applied when using the USoc data from the financial year ending 2010 and financial year ending 2018.  \n  \nIdentifying which factors affect a person’s likelihood of returning to work the most helps us to understand who might be more likely to experience the effects of scarring in the future. This is particularly important because [the unemployment rate has been rising.][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/latest"

      "markdown": "###About this article\n\nThis article is drawn from a qualitative analysis, intended to understand participants’ circumstances, attitudes and behaviour, rather than to be “representative” or measure the incidence of attitudes or behaviours. The term “many” is used when a view or behaviour is fairly widespread within a particular group of participants and “few” indicates findings applied only to a handful. “Some” indicates a middle ground between “many” and “few”. \n\nWe have included data from the [weekly Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) from 7 to 31 January][1], around the time that the interviews took place, to provide context for the quotes from interviewees. This analysis of compliance indicators was provided by age, ethnicity, income and parental status.  \n\n####Footnotes\n<br>\n#####Income \n\nThe study defined high-income participants as those with an annual household income of £47,000 a year after tax. The OPN's highest income bracket is an individual's income of £36,500 a year or more before tax. For low-income workers, the study defines this as a household income of £18,000 a year after tax, while the OPN’s lowest income bracket was an individual who had an income of £8,700 a year or less before tax. Personal annual gross income is self-reported on the OPN survey and therefore should be treated with caution. A respondent’s income information does not represent equivalised household income, which takes into account all income from all household members, and adjusts for that fact that households with more people will need a higher income to achieve the same standard of living as households with fewer members.   \n\n#####Parental status \n\nA parent in the study is defined as someone who was a parent or legal guardian of one or more children aged under 16 years, while in the OPN data an adult is defined as a parent if they are the parent of a dependent child living in their household. This includes children and stepchildren. A dependent child is someone under the age of 16 years or someone who is aged 16 to 18 years, has never been married and is in full-time education.\n\n#####Ethnicity \n\nThe ethnicity disaggregation used has been chosen to provide the most granular breakdown possible, while producing robust estimates based on sample sizes, in line with the [Government Statistical Service Ethnicity Harmonised standard][2]. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/latest\n  [2]: https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/ethnicity/"

Those working from home were also more likely to visit a park or local green space than those who travelled to work (45% compared with 30%). \n\n####Exercise levels were highest during lockdown in spring 2020 \n#####Percentage of adults leaving home for selected reasons (of adults who reported they had left home in the past seven days for any reason), Great Britain, 14 May 2020 to 18 April 2021 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1301/fig1/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Of adults who reported they had left home in the past seven days for any reason, Great Britain, 14 May 2020 to 18 April 2021\"/>\n\n[Data download][5]\n\nAlong with the rise in outdoor exercise, people’s interest in nature surged. In May 2020, 36% of people responding to the People and Nature Survey by Natural England said they were spending more time outside during the pandemic than before. This rose to 46% in July 2020. \n\n[Charities such as the RSPB and the Wildlife Trust saw spikes in web traffic in the first national lockdown][1]. Visits to the RSPB website increased by 69% year-on-year in March to May 2020 with 79% of those users being new to the website. In the same period, the RSPB recorded a tenfold increase in views of its [Build a bird box][2] web page. \n\nWhen lockdown restrictions lifted in summer 2020, people relied on the outdoors for leisure time and their holidays.  \n\nWith children’s playgrounds and similar places closed during lockdown, visits to parks, and time spent in them, fell in the spring, but the subsequent increase during the summer was greater in 2020 than in previous years, according to Google mobility data for the UK.  \n\n####Use of parks and public green spaces were up on previous years during summer 2020 \n#####Change in mobility to parks and public green spaces compared with a baseline period (3 January to 6 February 2020), Google mobility (UK, 2020) compared with Natural England (England, 2009 to 2018)\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1301/fig2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Change in mobility to parks and public green spaces compared with a baseline period (3 January to 6 February 2020), Google mobility (UK, 2020) compared with Natural England (England, 2009 to 2018)\"/>\n\n#####Notes: \n1. The chart is showing UK data for Google mobility and England data for MENE. Read our <a href=\"#about\">methodology</a> for more information on how to compare the two sources. \n2. Google mobility data are created with aggregated, anonymized sets of data from users who have turned on the Location History setting. \n3. Google mobility data have been smoothed by taking a weekly average of the index. Each day of the week has a different level of baseline mobility. However, the weekly average still provides a useful indication of the larger mobility trends. \n\n[Data download][6]\n\nSimilarly, while the British tourism sector struggled during summer 2020 because of limits on social contact, [camping holiday sales surged year-on-year in July and August][3] along with reports of [higher sales of outdoor products such as bicycles, leisure equipment and campervans][4]. \n\nWhile use of parks fell in rural and coastal areas during lockdown compared with pre-pandemic, there was a substantial rise in the summer, at least partly driven by domestic tourism. \n\nFor example, visits to and time spent in parks in Cornwall increased by 4% between the start of the year and lockdown, but then went on to rise by 280% between the start of the year and September, with similar patterns in Devon, Norfolk and East Yorkshire. High Peak and Ribble Valley are notable as two rural areas that saw high mobility both during lockdown and in September.  \n\n####Use of parks increased in rural and coastal areas during the summer compared with pre-pandemic, having fallen in the spring under lockdown restrictions \n#####Google mobility to parks and public green spaces compared with a pre-pandemic baseline (3 January to 6 February 2020)\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1301/side-by-side-map/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Google mobility to parks and public green spaces compared with a pre-pandemic baseline (3 January to 6 February 2020) \"/>\n\n#####Notes: \n1. The large increase in post lockdown mobility in coastal and rural areas compared with urban areas is likely to be driven by overnight tourism which would normally occur during this period. \n\n[Data download][7]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ft.com/content/51f9520b-2677-4c2e-aa45-fa16cc6bf3b2\n  [2]: https://www.rspb.org.uk/fun-and-learning/for-families/family-wild-challenge/activities/build-a-birdbox/?channel=paidsearch&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3oWBodSX6wIV14BQBh0k2wWAEAAYASAAEgJVefD_BwE\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/articles/theimpactofthecoronavirussofartheindustriesthatstruggledorrecovered/2020-12-09\n  [4]: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53826675\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1301/fig1/datadownload.xlsx\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1301/fig2/datadownload.xlsx\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1301/side-by-side-map/data/datadownload.xlsx"

The analysis presented in the chart covers green spaces in urban areas. Urban areas are estimated based on the [statistical definition of a built up area (BUA)][1].  \n2. The p-value - a measure of statistical significance - for the relationship between distance from nearest park and use of parks is less than 0.01 during the spring 2020 lockdown and less than 0.001 in July and August 2020. The lower the p-value, the lower the probability that the correlation has occurred by chance. \n\n[Data download][6]\n\nData also indicate a trade-off between private and public green space. Households in areas of the country with least access to private gardens are generally more likely to live close to a public park.  \n\nIn London, one in five (21%) households has no access to a private or shared garden, compared with 12% of households across Great Britain. And for those in London that do have access to a private garden, their gardens are 26% smaller than the national average. \n\nHowever, 44% of London residents are within an estimated five-minute walk of a park (this rises to 58% if playing fields are included). Both are the highest of any region or country in Great Britain.  \n\nDuring the first lockdown in April, use of public green space increased in London (compared with a normal year), contrasting with falls elsewhere. The largest declines were seen in Wales and Scotland. This may be due to different restrictions in the respective countries – [in normal times people in Wales are most likely to spend time outdoors][2].  \n\n<ons-chart path=\"762ba9cb\" />\n\nOf course, access to nearby green space does not guarantee that it is of sufficient quality (to want to spend time in) and size (to be able to maintain social distance).  \n\nA significant percentage (around 40%) of the population were concerned about overcrowding and not being able to keep their distance from others when visiting their local green and natural spaces, according to [analysis of Natural England’s People and Nature Survey by the New Economics Foundation (NEF)][3].  \n\nThe [average park in Great Britain serves just under 2,000 people][4], although some parks in densely populated areas such as London cater for many more people. Around 46,000 people in London have Clapham Common as their nearest park, more than 20 times the average. \n\nThe NEF analysis that highlighted concerns about overcrowding found that around one in eight people (12.5%) don’t believe that their local green space is of a high enough standard to want to spend time in. People on lower incomes report greater dissatisfaction with the quality of their green space than those on higher incomes. \n\nThe quality of nearby green space may have affected the way people spent their time during lockdown. [According to our Time Use Survey][5], people in high-income households were spending twice as long keeping fit in April 2020 – through exercise classes and gym, running and jogging, team sports, and other sport – as those in low-income households (32 minutes per day compared with 16 minutes).  \n\nThose from high-income households increased their time spent keeping fit by 36% during lockdown compared with 2015 (the most recent pre-pandemic data).

      "markdown": "The pandemic has underlined the importance of outdoor space, for people and policymakers. \n\nIn October 2020, [the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS) asked companies about homeworking as a future business model][1]. Around 1 in 6 (17%) businesses intended to move to homeworking permanently, with 61% of these pointing to improved staff wellbeing as a reason for the change. \n\nThis could explain why our housing preferences are changing. [Growth in sales of detached houses is outstripping that of flats][2]. Meanwhile, [Cornwall has overtaken London as the most searched-for location on Rightmove this year][3], with Devon and Dorset also in the top 10.   \n\nHowever, the interest in nature that we saw in spring and summer 2020 has not necessarily carried through to winter 2020 and early 2021. A [University College London (UCL) survey suggests that many of the lifestyle changes adopted during the first national lockdown had slipped][4], with people instead spending more time watching television, which may be unsurprising because of the colder and darker weather. \n\nIt could be that the people most likely to maintain lockdown lifestyle changes, such as increased exercise and visits to green spaces, are those whose circumstances most allow them to, such as those whose workplaces decide to offer homeworking permanently. \n\n<ons-chart path=\"2778d324\" />\n\nIf businesses were to carry out their plans to continue offering homeworking following the pandemic, it could lead to an influx of wealthier people of working age (the demographic who are more likely to spend time in nature recreationally) moving to rural and coastal areas. \n\nMidway through September 2020, [around 3 in 10 (29%) working adults said that they intend to continue working from home after the pandemic all or most of the time][5]. Among those people, 12% said they had considered relocating, mostly to rural or coastal areas, places that typically have a high percentage of retired people. \n\nAt the time of the 2011 census, the distribution of homeworkers was most concentrated in small coastal communities such as [Tintagel, Porlock and Lynton in the South West (30 to 35%)][6] and certain rural areas such as West Somerset, Ceredigion and Powys (22 to 26%).

      "title": "About the data",
      "markdown": "<h4 id=\"about\">Google mobility</h4> \n\nGoogle defines “mobility” as visits to and time spent at a categorised area. The category of parks includes public gardens, national forests, campgrounds, and [other outdoor spaces][1]. This does not refer to the general outdoors found in rural areas. To understand mobility trends during the coronavirus pandemic, Google compares mobility on a given weekday to the median mobility on that weekday in a five-week period before the pandemic (the baseline). This baseline period is from 3 January 2020 to 6 February 2020. The mobility figure for a given day is the percentage change in mobility compared with the corresponding median for that day in the baseline period.  \n\nThe baseline period occurs in winter, when there are fewer visits to parks. Without coronavirus restrictions, we would expect visits to parks to increase in the spring and summer.  \n\nUsing historical data from the [Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) survey][2] we attempt to normalise for seasonal changes in mobility to parks. MENE data cover England only and counts the number of short visits made by residents of a region. Estimates for Scotland and Wales are based on visit data for the whole of England. [Google mobility data][3] includes overnight tourism, so for the post-lockdown period where restrictions on overnight stays had been lifted, normalisation is less effective. \n\nThe lockdown period referred to in this article is from 23 March 2020 to 4 July 2020. For each geography, an average percent change in mobility from the baseline is taken across all dates for which data are available. The number of dates from which an average is taken varies by geography. This is repeated for a post-lockdown period, which is from 5 July 2020 to 4 September 2020. Mobility data are available for all [Google geographies][4] in the lockdown period (350 Local Authority Districts and two Counties), but there are 13 geographies for which post-lockdown mobility data are unavailable.  \n\n####Ordnance Survey \n\nWe use [Ordnance Survey data][5] to estimate access to local greenspaces across Great Britain. This is done at postcode level, with business and rural postcodes removed to show data for residential urban areas only. Urban postcodes are most appropriate for estimates of proximity to greenspace and linking with the google mobility data. We also provide data tables for all residential postcodes (including rural). This postcode level data are aggregated to larger geographies and weighted on [LSOA level population data][6] from the 2011 Census. Two datasets are used to measure the minimum and maximum level of public access to greenspace. One contains “parks” and “public gardens”; the other also contains “playing fields” which may be private.  \n\nAccess to private gardens data are matched to access to greenspace data on postcode. The average garden size for flats at postcode level are estimated from MSOA level aggregates. The average garden size for flats and houses at larger geographies are aggregated from postcode level and weighted on both LSOA level population data and the number of flats or houses in that geography. \n\n\n  [1]: https://support.google.com/covid19-mobility/answer/9824897?hl=en&ref_topic=9822927\n  [2]: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/monitor-of-engagement-with-the-natural-environment-survey-purpose-and-results\n  [3]: https://github.com/datasciencecampus/google-mobility-reports-data/blob/master/csvs/uk-all-trends.csv\n  [4]: https://github.com/datasciencecampus/google-mobility-reports-data/blob/master/geography/Google_Places_Lookup_Table_200403.csv\n  [5]: https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/open-map-greenspace\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011census/2011censusdata/2011censusdatacatalogue/populationstatisticsfortheuk"

Estimates include people living in private households, and do not include those in communal establishments such as halls of residence, prisons, schools, hospitals, or care homes. \n\n2. Date of first (suspected) coronavirus episode was taken to be the earliest of: date of first positive test for the coronavirus during study follow-up; date of first self-reported positive test for the coronavirus outside of study follow-up; and date of first suspected coronavirus infection, as reported by the participant. Those with an unknown date of first (suspected) coronavirus episode are included in the estimates for ”any duration” but not for ``duration at least 12 weeks”. \n\n3. Participants who were not working or did not report an employment sector are not included in estimates broken down by employment sector. \n\n4. Pre-existing health status is self-reported by study participants rather than clinically diagnosed. From February 2021, study participants were explicitly asked to exclude any symptoms related to the coronavirus when reporting their pre-existing health status. \n\n5. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. \n\n[Download the data][1]\n\nSex, employment sector and age are among a number of characteristics that are related to rates of self-reported long COVID. \n\nLong COVID was defined as symptoms persisting for more than four weeks after the first suspected coronavirus episode that are not explained by something else. \n\n[Our analysis on the prevalence of ongoing symptoms following COVID-19 infection among people living in private households in the UK][2] showed that in the four-week period ending 6 March 2021, the prevalence rates of self-reported long COVID were greatest in people aged 35 to 49 years (2.5%), and in those aged 50 to 69 years (2.4%). \n \nAll the adult age groups had statistically significantly higher rates of self-reported long COVID than those aged between 2 and 16 years. \n\nThe data also showed that the prevalence rate was [statistically significantly][3] higher in women (1.9%) than in men (1.5%). \n\nEach factor is considered in isolation without adjusting for the effect of others, so it is not possible to infer cause-and-effect relationships from these results. Long COVID covers a broad range of symptoms such as fatigue, muscle pain, and difficulty concentrating. There is no universally agreed definition. \n\nAs well as age and sex, the data has shown that those who live in the most deprived areas experience higher rates of self-reported long COVID (2.2%), compared with those in the least deprived areas (1.4%). \n\nIn terms of differences between employment sectors, health and social care workers had the highest rates of self-reported long COVID (3.6% and 3.1% respectively). This may be the result of more exposure to the coronavirus as well as greater awareness of long COVID. \n\nPeople with self-reported, pre-existing health conditions that affected their day-to-day activities  a lot experienced a prevalence rate of self-reported long COVID of 4.0% compared with 3.4% for people whose day-to-day activities  were limited a little. They had statistically significantly higher prevalence rates of self-reported long COVID than those without limiting health conditions (2.2%). Those without any pre-existing health conditions experienced a lower rate still at 1.5%. \n\nThere was an overall estimated 1.1 million people in private UK households who reported experiencing long COVID (symptoms persisting more than four weeks after the first suspected coronavirus episode that are not explained by something else). \n\nThis was over the four-week period ending 6 March 2021; 932,000 of these people lived in England, 56,000 in Wales, 79,000 in Scotland, and 26,000 in Northern Ireland. \n\nThere were an estimated 674,000 (61.6%) people in the UK who reported having long COVID symptoms say their day-to-day activities were being adversely affected. \n\nOf those, 196,000 (17.9%) reported their day-to-day activities were limited a lot, [our data on the prevalence of ongoing symptoms][4] has shown.  \n\n \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1316/long-covid/datadownload.xlsx\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/1april2021\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/uncertaintyandhowwemeasureit#statistical-significance\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/1april2021"

Single households are defined as households without children including couples without children, as well as single adults.  \n\n2. Households in Temporary Accommodation are as reported at the end of each quarter. Q1 represents 31 March, Q2 30 June, Q3 30 September, Q4 31 December. \n\n3. Data for Q4 2020 are currently provisional. \n\n4. Total figures are presented rounded to the nearest 10 households. \n\n[Download the data][1]\n\nThe number  of households in England in temporary accommodation during the coronavirus pandemic has increased since the last quarter. \n\nNewly-released data from the [Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG)(PDF, 4.18MB)][2] shows 95,370 in temporary accommodation at 31 December 2020, a 1% increase from 94,610 on 30 September 2020. It’s also an increase of 8% in the same period in 2019 from 88,310.  \n\nThis increase is driven by single adult households, which was 28,570 at 31 December 2020, up 45% on the same date in 2019. The number of households with children was 59,670 (or 63%), down 5% on the same date in 2019. This compares with 62,560 or 71% on the same date in 2019. \n\nOn 30 June 2020, the number of households in temporary accommodation  reached a peak of 98,260, a 14% increase on the same period in 2019, when there were 86,240 households in temporary accommodation. \n\nAs part of a drive ([Everyone In][3]) to get rough sleepers off the streets during the coronavirus pandemic, local authorities provided accommodation to people in their area who were rough sleeping, in shelters with shared sleeping areas or were at risk of rough sleeping. \n\nThe Everyone In response involved a significant change in the way local authority powers and duties were delivered towards single households (households without children), in the context of the pandemic.  \n\nThe number of households in temporary accommodation in England had increased annually by an average of 5.1% across all quarters in 2019. This was exceeded by the year-on-year increase in June 2020. \n\nOther aspects of [support included mortgage payment holidays][4], a [stay on possession proceedings][5] and an [extension of notice periods][6].  \n\nThis may explain why the number of households with children in temporary accommodation has decreased, in that households who took advantage of these support mechanisms avoided the prospect of becoming homeless. \n\nThere were  10,510 households in bed and breakfast accommodation on 31 December 2020. This represents a 43% increase from 7,330 at the same period in 2019. \n\nThe figures show that 88% of households in bed and breakfast accommodation were single households (households without children). This equates to 9,230 and an increase of 270 from the previous quarter. \n\nWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland  also experienced an increase in households in temporary accommodation. \n\n[In Wales, 2,324 households were placed in temporary accommodation][7] at 31 March 2020, an increase of 4% on March 2019. The data refers to homelessness as defined by the Housing (Wales) Act 2014. \n\nNational lockdown measures went into effect on 23 March 2020, which has affected the total of households in temporary accommodation in Wales at 31 March 2020. [More recent information on homelessness is available][8], which is not comparable with statutory homelessness data. \n\nIn [Northern Ireland][9], the number of placements in temporary accommodation more-than doubled, from 2,175 in July to December 2019, to 4,677 in July to December 2020.  \n\nIn [Scotland][10], at 30 September 2020, there was a 24% increase in the number of  households in temporary accommodation compared with the same period in 2019.   \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1316/homelessness-TA/datadownload.xlsx\n  [2]: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/979393/Statutory_homelessness_release_Oct-Dec_2020.pdf\n  [3]: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9057/\n  [4]: https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/dealing-financial-difficulties-coronavirus\n  [5]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-and-renting-guidance-for-landlords-tenants-and-local-authorities/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-landlords-and-tenants\n  [6]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-and-renting-guidance-for-landlords-tenants-and-local-authorities/technical-guidance-on-eviction-notices\n  [7]: https://gov.wales/homelessness-april-2019-march-2020\n  [8]: https://gov.wales/homelessness-accommodation-provision-and-rough-sleeping\n  [9]: https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/system/files/publications/communities/ni-homelessness-bulletin-jul-dec-2020.pdf\n  [10]: https://www.gov.scot/publications/homelessness-scotland-update-30-september-2020/"

Question: \"In which ways is coronavirus affecting your life?\". \n\n2. Respondents asked to select all that apply. \n\n3. Base population for percentage: disabled or non-disabled people. \n\n4. February 2021 refers to the collection period 3 to 28 February. See Section 9: Data sources and quality in the [latest publication][1] for more information on the dates covered within this period.  \n\n5. Lower and upper 95% confidence levels form a confidence interval, which is a measure of the statistical precision of an estimate and shows the range of uncertainty around the calculated estimate. As a general rule, if the confidence interval around one estimate overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between the two estimates. \n\n[Download the data][2]\n\nMore disabled people continue to be worried about the effect of the coronavirus than non-disabled people. \n\nData published in the [Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (February 2021][3]), showed the social impact of the coronavirus pandemic on disabled people in Great Britain between the 3 to 28 February 2021.  \n\nWhile a larger proportion of disabled people (78%) than non-disabled people (69%) said they were worried (very or somewhat) about the effect of the coronavirus on their lives, the proportions were smaller compared with September 2020. \n\nIn September 2020, 83% of disabled people said they were worried about the effect that the coronavirus was having on their lives, compared with 71% of non-disabled people. \n\nThere was also a difference in the way in which the coronavirus impacted on disabled and non-disabled people. \n\nFor disabled people in February 2021, the impact of the virus on their well-being (65%) and lack of freedom and independence (62%) were most often mentioned as ways their lives were affected. For non-disabled people, lack of freedom and independence (68%) was the area of life most affected.  \n\nDisabled people more often indicated coronavirus had affected their life than non-disabled people in ways such as their health (35% for disabled people, compared with 12% for non-disabled people), access to healthcare for non-coronavirus related issues (40% compared with 19%), well-being (65% compared with 50%) and access to groceries, medication and essentials (27% compared with 12%). \n\nNon-disabled people more often said in February 2021 than in September 2020 that coronavirus affected their well-being (50% compared with 42%), life events (45% compared with 39%), exercise routine (35% compared with 23%) and relationships (29% compared to 21%).   \n\nSeparate data from the [NISRA Coronavirus (COVID-19) Opinion Survey Phases 1 to 10][4] showed that in Northern Ireland, people with a limiting longstanding illness reported significantly lower rates of life satisfaction, feelings of worthwhile and happiness than people without a limiting longstanding illness. They also had higher rates of anxiety.  \n\nAlthough the data - which covers 21 April 2020 to 3 April 2021 -  is not directly comparable with the rest of the UK, it is in line with trends across the UK documenting poorer well-being outcomes for disabled people. \n\n#####Note: \n\nThe term \"limiting longstanding illness\" has been used as a proxy to produce data on individuals considered to be disabled according to the Disability Discrimination Act. The act considers a person disabled if they have a longstanding physical or mental condition or disability that has lasted or is likely to last at least 12 months, and if this condition or disability has a substantial adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/disability/articles/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsondisabledpeopleingreatbritain/february2021#data-sources-and-quality\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1316/disabled/datadownload.xlsx\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsondisabledpeopleingreatbritainfebruary2021\n  [4]: https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/nisra-coronavirus-covid-19-opinion-survey"

Our analysis shows that many of these deaths at home were people who, in a non-pandemic year, may have typically died elsewhere such as in hospital.  \n\nDeaths in hospital were 4% above the five-year average. However, if deaths due to COVID-19 are excluded, then deaths in hospitals would have been 16% lower than the average. \n\nOur first release of the finalised mortality data for 2020 shows that “excess deaths” from all causes were 14% above the five-year average in England and Wales, with the coronavirus (COVID-19) being the main reason for excess deaths. \n\nExcess deaths are the difference between the number of deaths registered in 2020 and the five-year average (2015 to 2019). Using the average gives us a comparison of how many deaths we would expect in a \"usual\" year, before the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nThere were almost 76,000 more deaths from all causes and in all locations (hospitals, care homes, private homes and elsewhere) in England and Wales in 2020 than the five-year average. COVID-19 was responsible for 97% of the excess, having not previously existed. \n\nThis analysis looks at England and Wales as a whole; trends for the two countries may differ and are shown separately in the charts and data tables.

Though deaths from this cause had generally been increasing over time prior to the pandemic, the rise between 2019 and 2020 was larger than seen in recent years. Proportionally, the biggest shift in deaths by this cause was in deaths in private homes, with nearly 2,400 in 2020 compared with an expected 1,800 (a rise of 31%). Analysis from Public Health England and academic studies has suggested that [alcohol consumption in higher-risk drinkers increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but more research is needed to fully understand the impact on mortality][1].  \n\nIncreases in deaths from these causes were the highest above the expected range, using z-scores. \n\nThe z-scores are a more meaningful measure than percentage changes, which can be skewed by small numbers. \n\nThere were 8,000 fewer deaths in England and Wales than expected from \"influenza and pneumonia\", likely due in part to social distancing reducing the spread.  \n\n\"Bronchitis, emphysema and other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\" and \"renal failure\" were the underlying causes of death that fell the farthest below what was expected based on their five-year averages.   \n\n####Heart diseases caused significantly more deaths than normal during 2020 \n#####Causes of death, ranked by their deviation from the 2015 to 2019 average, England and Wales, deaths registered in 2020 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1309/fig3_zscoredeaths/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Heart diseases caused significantly more deaths than normal during 2020 \"/>\n\n\n\n#####Notes: \n1.

      "markdown": "<h2 id=\"about\">About this article</h2>\n\n####Excess deaths  \n\nIn this article, “excess” deaths are defined as the difference between the number of deaths registered in 2020 and the 2015 to 2019 average. The average provides a comparison of how many deaths we would expect in a usual year. A five-year period was used because there has been relatively little year-on-year population change over the last five years (less than 1% increase each year). \n\nZ-scores demonstrate how mortality in 2020 differed from the five-year average. The Z-score is the number of standard deviations the observed number of deaths (registered in 2020) is from the average (2015 to 2019). Z-scores can be used to determine [statistical significance][1]. In this analysis, a Z-score of 0 means the number of deaths in 2020 was the same as the five-year average.  \n\n####COVID-19 deaths \n\n[The World Health Organization (WHO) defines coronaviruses][2] as \"a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)\". Between 2001 and 2018, there were 12 deaths in England and Wales due to a coronavirus infection. COVID-19 refers to the \"coronavirus disease 2019\" and is a disease caused by a specific type of coronavirus. \n\nDeaths \"due to COVID-19\" are deaths registered in England and Wales where COVID-19 was the underlying (main) cause on the death certificate. A doctor can certify the involvement of COVID-19 based on symptoms and clinical findings – a positive test result is not required. International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition ([ICD-10][3]) codes U.071, U.072, and U10.9 are included in our \"due to COVID-19\" definition. This article uses finalised mortality data for 2020, so numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 differ from figures in other publications based on provisional data, such as [weekly deaths][4]. \n\n####Causes of death \n\nThe ONS has a [short list][5] for cause of death, developed in consultation with the Department of Health and Social Care, and based on one developed by the WHO. This list uses more specific groupings than the broad group level, splitting causes such as cancer and circulatory diseases into different subtypes, to provide policymakers with enough detail to generate appropriate health policies. In this article, short list cause groups with under 1,000 deaths in 2020 were merged with other groups to reduce problems associated with small counts. For more information on the groupings used see the Definitions tab of the [accompanying dataset][6].  \n\nThis analysis focuses on the [underlying cause of death][7] only. Multiple health conditions that contributed to a death can be mentioned on the death certificate, and from these a single underlying (main) cause of death is derived using a [set of rules][8]. Information on [pre-existing conditions of people who died due to COVID-19][9] is available based on provisional data.  \n\n####Registration delays \n\nThis analysis focuses on deaths registered in 2020; there is a [delay between a death happening and it being registered][10], so some of the 2020 death registrations will have occurred in previous years. Deaths from external causes, such as accidents, violence and suicides can only be registered after investigation by a coroner. This process has been impacted by the pandemic, affecting the number of death registrations in 2020 from these causes. \n\nMore quality and methodology information is available in the [Mortality statistics in England and Wales QMI][11] and the [User Guide to Mortality Statistics][12]. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/uncertaintyandhowwemeasureit#statistical-significance\n  [2]: https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1\n  [3]: https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/latest\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatisticsjuly2017#ons-short-list-of-cause-of-death)\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/excessdeathsinenglandandwales2020final\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatisticsjuly2017#cause-of-death-coding\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/causeofdeathcodinginmortalitystatisticssoftwarechanges/january2020\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/monthlymortalityanalysisenglandandwales/january2021#pre-existing-conditions-of-people-whose-death-was-recorded-with-an-underlying-cause-of-covid-19-deaths-registered-in-2020\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/impactofregistrationdelaysonmortalitystatisticsinenglandandwales/2019\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/mortalitystatisticsinenglandandwalesqmi\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatisticsjuly2017"

A lower proportion of staff in care homes in London are vaccinated than in other areas</h2>\n\n####Cumulative proportion of older adult care home staff who have received a first dose by region, December 2020 to April 2021, England \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1384/carehome/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"A lower proportion of staff in care homes in London are vaccinated than in other areas \"/>\n\n####Notes \n1. Data are taken from monthly adult social care statistics published by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). Data in this publication are collected up to 11.59pm on a Tuesday. Vaccination data for social care settings are also published weekly by NHS England and Improvement (NHSEI) as part of their broader statistical release on [COVID-19 vaccinations][1]. The NHSEI publications use the same methodology and data source as the DHSC publications but the data cover vaccinations reported up to 11:59pm of the previous Sunday each week. \n2. Older adult care homes are defined as care homes serving any older people (aged 65 years and over) as identified from the latest Care Quality Commission (CQC) data on care homes in the “older people service” user band. A small number of residents within care homes serving older people may be aged under 65 years. \n\n[Download the data][2] \n\nAs of 27 April 2021, 95% of residents in older adult care homes (aged 65 years and over) and 81% of older adult care home staff in England had received their first coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine dose, according to [recent adult social care monthly statistics][3], published by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).  \n\nOlder adult care homes and their staff were in the first [priority group][4] for receiving a COVID-19 vaccine according to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommendation. \n\nWhile first-dose vaccination rates are similar across all regions of England for residents in older adult care homes, there is considerable variation across regions for staff. In London, as of 27 April 2021, 72% of staff had received their first dose compared with 87% in the North East.  \n\nThis reflects trends seen in the wider population, with [NHS vaccination data][5] showing that rates among all age groups are slightly lower in London than in other English regions.  \n\nAnalysis of responses to the ONS’s Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) in April suggested [vaccine hesitancy][6] was higher in London, with 12% of adults in London expressing some level of vaccine hesitancy compared with 7% of adults in England as a whole. In addition, the data suggested that across Great Britain, vaccine hesitancy was slightly higher for those employed in adult social care (9%) compared with frontline medical care staff (4%) and those employed in other occupations (7%).  A government consultation was recently held on [making vaccination a condition of deployment in older adult care homes][7], the outcome of which is yet to be published. \n\n[Separate data for Wales][8], suggest that 98% of older adult care home residents and 92% of older adult care home staff have received their first dose as of 26 May 2021. \n\n[Data for Scotland][9] suggest that 97% of older adult care home residents and 100% of staff in all care homes have received their first dose as of 26 May 2021.  \n\nData for adult social care staff and residents in England up to 16 May 2021 are available as part of [NHS England and Improvement’s (NHSEI) broader statistical release on COVID-19 vaccinations][10].  \n\nComparisons across the three nations should be made with caution because of differences in reporting period, and potential differences in methodology. Further methodological information on [England][11] and [Scotland][12] data is available. \n\n<a href=\"#toc\">Back to the top</a>\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1384/carehome/datadownload.xlsx\n  [3]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-social-care-in-england-monthly-statistics-may-2021/adult-social-care-monthly-statistics-england-may-2021\n  [4]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/priority-groups-for-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-advice-from-the-jcvi-30-december-2020/joint-committee-on-vaccination-and-immunisation-advice-on-priority-groups-for-covid-19-vaccination-30-december-2020\n  [5]: https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/datasets/coronavirusandvaccinehesitancygreatbritain\n  [7]: https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/making-vaccination-a-condition-of-deployment-in-older-adult-care-homes/making-vaccination-a-condition-of-deployment-in-older-adult-care-homes\n  [8]: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/public.health.wales.health.protection/viz/RapidCOVID-19virology-Public/Vaccination\n  [9]: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/phs.covid.19/viz/COVID-19DailyDashboard_15960160643010/Overview\n  [10]: https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/\n  [11]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/adult-social-care-in-england-statistics-england-methodology\n  [12]: https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccinations-data---technical-note/"

Data for England and Wales are final. Data for Scotland and Northern Ireland are provisional and subject to change. \n2. Based on date a death was registered rather than occurred. \n3. Please note figures for England and Wales are based on data [published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS)][1], figures for Northern Ireland were provided by the [Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA)][2] and figures on Scotland were provided by [National Records of Scotland (NRS).][3] Therefore, there are some differences in how the data are defined and as such they should be compared with caution. Please see the data download for more information. \n\n[Download the data][4]\n\nIn April 2020, [excess deaths in care homes][5] across the UK peaked at more than double usual levels and were also above average in all other locations. As coronavirus (COVID-19) infections fell during the summer, deaths in care homes, hospitals and other locations fell below the five-year average.  However, deaths remained above average in private homes for the rest of the year. \n\nMany of the deaths in private homes were people who, in a non-pandemic year, may have typically died in a hospital. The majority of deaths due to COVID-19 (where the coronavirus was the underlying cause) occurred in hospitals and care homes, while many deaths from other causes, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer, happened in private homes. More detailed analysis of excess deaths by cause is available for [England and Wales][6], [Northern Ireland][7] and [Scotland.][8] \n\n[In England and Wales][9], the most deprived areas saw higher increases in excess deaths in hospitals and care homes in 2020 than the least deprived areas. However, this trend reversed when looking at excess deaths in private homes, where the least deprived areas of the country saw higher increases in 2020 than the most deprived areas.  \n\nIn the least deprived areas of England, deaths in private homes were 37.9% above the five-year average in 2020 compared with a 29.4% increase in the most deprived areas. In Wales, deaths in private homes in the least deprived areas were 46.9% above the five-year average compared with a 28.9% increase in the most deprived areas.  \n\n<a href=\"#toc\">Back to the top</a>\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/deathsathomeincreasedbyathirdin2020whiledeathsinhospitalsfellexceptforcovid19/2021-05-07\n  [2]: https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/excess-mortality-covid-19-related-deaths\n  [3]: https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/general-publications/weekly-and-monthly-data-on-births-and-deaths/deaths-involving-coronavirus-covid-19-in-scotland\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1384/excess-deaths/datadownload.xlsx\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/deathsathomeincreasedbyathirdin2020whiledeathsinhospitalsfellexceptforcovid19/2021-05-07\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/deathsathomeincreasedbyathirdin2020whiledeathsinhospitalsfellexceptforcovid19/2021-05-07\n  [7]: https://www.nisra.gov.uk/sites/nisra.gov.uk/files/publications/Excess%20mortality%20%26%20Covid-19%20related%20deaths%20in%20Northern%20Ireland-Mar-Dec%202020.pdf\n  [8]: https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/statistics/covid19/covid-deaths-21-report-week-19.pdf\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/excessdeathsinenglandandwales2020final"

A child is any person aged under 16 years. \n\n[Download the data][1]\n\nDuring the early 2021 lockdown (27 January to 7 March), the proportion of adults experiencing some form of depression was higher than November 2020, and more than double the rate seen before the pandemic, according to [Opinions and Lifestyle Survey data.][2] \n\nYounger adults and people living with a child aged under 16 years in Great Britain had the largest increases in rates of depressive symptoms in early 2021 compared with pre-pandemic levels. Around 3 in 10 adults aged 16 to 39 years (29%) experienced some form of depression (indicated by moderate to severe depressive symptoms), compared with 11% in July 2019 to March 2020.  \n\nRates of depression doubled among adults aged 70 years and over in the same period but were much lower overall than those seen in the younger age groups.  \n\nSeparate data from the [NISRA Coronavirus (COVID-19) Opinion Survey Phases 1 to 10][3] showed that in Northern Ireland, when restrictions were reintroduced, just over a quarter of people (28%) had a high [general health questionnaire (GHQ-12)][4] score, which could indicate a possible mental health problem. This was significantly higher than the most recent figure published by the Health Survey Northern Ireland for 2019 to 2020 (19%).  \n\nAlthough the data – which cover January to April 2021 – are not directly comparable with the rest of the UK, it seems there has been an increase in mental health problems during the coronavirus pandemic period.  \n\n<a href=\"#toc\">Back to the top</a>\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1384/depressed-change/datadownload.xlsx\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/coronavirusanddepressioninadultsgreatbritain/januarytomarch2021\n  [3]: https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/nisra-coronavirus-covid-19-opinion-survey\n  [4]: https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nisra.gov.uk%2Fsystem%2Ffiles%2Fstatistics%2FNISRA%2520COVID-19%2520Survey%2520Key%2520Findings.pdf%23page%3D13&data=04%7C01%7CKatie.Edser%40ons.gov.uk%7C494b80a140254f0cc67808d91c4375a7%7C078807bfce824688bce00d811684dc46%7C0%7C0%7C637571898922652530%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=B9rCrNN%2B9%2Bg%2BZImSyFQRIC9QFBX0piRu%2F4wvT%2Fw3mPY%3D&reserved=0"

This compares with 12.4% of the workforce in 2019.  \n\nHowever, workers aged 25 years and under were less likely to work from home than older workers, with 3.6% of 16- to 19-year-olds and 14.8% of 20- to 24-year-olds reporting working from home at some point in the week prior to interview, compared with 34.9% of those aged 70 years and over.  \n\nYounger workers were also less likely to work from home before the pandemic but the trend has intensified over the last year. This is likely to reflect younger workers' tendency to work in the accommodation and food service activities, and the arts, entertainment and recreation industries. The impact of the pandemic also meant that workers in these industries were more likely to be furloughed, or unable to work from home during the pandemic. \n\nAdults aged 70 years and over were advised by the UK government to take particular care in minimising contact with others outside their household to protect themselves from catching COVID-19. \n\nWe have recently published a [blog comparing the different data sources measuring levels of homeworking][2] during the pandemic. \n\n<a href=\"#toc\">Back to the top</a>\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/homeworkingintheuklabourmarket\n  [2]: https://blog.ons.gov.uk/2021/05/17/working-from-home-comparing-the-data/"

Similar restrictions were lifted in Scotland on April 26.  \n\nAll retailers apart from food stores reported monthly growth in sales in April, with clothing stores seeing a 69.4% increase in sales as physical stores were able to reopen.  \n\nIn comparison, non-store retailers (mostly online-only businesses with no physical shops) reported modest monthly growth of 1.0% in April, although their sales volumes remain 53.1% higher than their February 2020 pre-pandemic level. All retail sectors except non-store retailers reported a fall in their proportions of online sales as physical stores reopened during the month. The total proportion of sales online decreased to 30.0%, down from 34.7% in March 2021. \n\nDespite also seeing growth, the automotive fuel sector is yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels, with current sales down 9.9% when compared with February 2020.

At that time there were 38,870 pubs and bars in the UK employing 467,000 people.\n\nWhile funding schemes have been introduced by the government to help keep these businesses alive until they are able to resume trading fully, the [series of lockdown measures][2] have resulted in the establishments shutting up shop for months at a time.\n\n<ons-quote content=\"We cannot cover our outgoings; we are constantly accruing debt.\" attr=\"Pub and bar owners, February 2021\" />\n\nFor this article, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) is using the results of the [Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS)][3] from October 2020 onwards, which shows that in October 2020, just 6% of landlords had “high confidence” that their establishments would survive beyond three months. By early February 2021, the proportion of “high confidence” had dropped to its lowest recorded level of 1%.\n\n####Pub and bar business confidence has been weak compared with all other businesses but is starting to improve\n#####Percentage of businesses who reported high, medium and low confidence of survival over the next three months, UK, 2 November 2020 to 16 May 2021\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1401/confidence/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Confidence chart\"/>\n\n#####Notes: \n1.\tFinal weighted results Wave 17 to 30 of the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS’) Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS).\n\n2.\tWaves may not add to 100% because of rounding and exclusion of other responses: \"no confidence\" and \"not sure\" being removed.\n\n3.\tCaution should be taken when interpreting the results for pubs and bars because of a small sample size, sample variation and possible drop off because of some of the pubs closing down. \n\n[Download pub and bar business confidence data (XLSX, 12KB)][4]\n\nIn the past month, there has been a revival of confidence, with the most recent data for early May 2021 showing 24% of pub and bar owners had “high confidence” about the survival of their business beyond three months. \n\nThis return of confidence could have been the result of the unveiling of the [road map out of the pandemic][5] and the subsequent reopening of hospitality.\n\n<ons-quote content=\"Our pub is financially hanging on by a thread.\" attr=\"Pub and bar owners, February 2021\" />\n\nWhile the return of “high confidence” has shown promising signs of recovery, the drop in the number of pub and bar bosses who felt “low confidence” in the ability of their business to survive the next three months failed to last.\n\nThat “low confidence” dropped from 63% in November 2020 to 3% by April 2021, but by early May 2021, had risen significantly to 19%.\n\nConfidence among pub and bar owners has been both considerably lower and less stable, than that of other business owners.\n\n##Furlough scheme has been vital for pub staff\nPrior to the pandemic, employment in pubs and bars (particularly pub chains) was increasing, as we showed in our previous [Economies of ale article][6]. Given the interruptions to trade in 2020, it’s likely that staffing levels will have changed significantly. [Wider reports from those representing the hospitality industries][7] suggest jobs may have been lost during the pandemic, with workers retraining for other industries.\n\nThe government’s [HM Revenue and Customs Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS)][8], also known as furlough, has been an important means of business support during the pandemic. It has enabled landlords to keep staff on their books while their establishments have been closed.\n\n<ons-quote content=\"While the furlough scheme has been a means of survival, it’s pointless if they have no job to come back to.\" attr=\"Pub and bar owners, November 2020\" />\n\nAt its peak in the November 2020 lockdown, 91% of pub and bar staff were on furlough. This number has now decreased to 55%.\n\nThis compares with overall 8% to 15% of staff on furlough in all other businesses during the same period, indicating the heavier reliance of pubs and bars on the scheme.\n\nWe can increasingly see a downward trend of pub and bar staff on furlough since restrictions were lifted on beer gardens. Despite this, the percentage of staff that were on furlough has remained high. This suggests that where pubs and bars have been open, they have been operating with minimal staff.\n\n####The percentage of the workforce on furlough in pub and bar businesses is considerably higher than that of all other businesses\n#####Percentage of workforce reportedly on furlough, UK, 19 October 2020 to 2 May 2021\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1401/furlough/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Furlough chart\"/>\n\n#####Notes: \n1.\tFinal weighted results Wave 17 to 30 of the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS’) Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS).\n\n2.\tCaution should be taken when interpreting the results for pubs and bars because of a small sample size, sample variation and possible drop off because of some of the pubs closing down. \n\n[Download data on the percentage of the pub and bar workforce on furlough (XLSX, 11KB)][9]\n\nNot all pub and bar jobs will have been saved by the furlough scheme. In the weeks just after Christmas 2020, 12% of pubs and bars reported that it was likely they would make redundancies in the next three months. This number fell to approximately 4% by late February 2021. It is unclear whether this is because of increased certainty or because the redundancies had already gone through.\n\n##Run up to Christmas was financially difficult for pubs\n\nThe weeks leading up to Christmas are normally busy for pubs and bars, but December 2020 saw huge losses in trade.\n\n<ons-quote content=\"Missing out on Christmas trade has been detrimental.\" attr=\"Pub and bar owners, December 2020\" />\n\nThe [tier system][10], introduced on 2 December 2020, placed areas of England under specific sets of restrictions. Pubs and bars in areas placed under tier 3 and 4, the strictest of conditions, had to close. The tier system was replaced in England on 4 January 2021 by another [national lockdown][11].\n\nBy mid-December 2020, more than 80% of pubs and bars recorded that their profits were more than 50% below what they would normally expect for the time of year, with that number soaring to 100% by late December 2020.\n\n####Profit losses of all pubs and bars were more than 50% lower than normal expectations for Christmas 2020\n#####Percentage of businesses who reported profits had decreased by more than 50% of normal expectations, UK, 19 October 2020 to 2 May 2021\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1401/profits/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Profits and loss chart\"/>\n\n#####Notes: \n1. Final weighted results Wave 17 to 30 of the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS’) Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS).\n\n2. Waves may not add to 100% due to rounding and exclusion of other responses: \"Profits have increased by more than 50%\", \"Profits have increased by between 20% and 50%\", \"Profits have increased by up to 20%\", \"Profits have stayed the same\", \"Profits have decreased by up to 20%\", \"Profits have decreased by between 20% and 50%\", \"not sure\" and \"not applicable\".\n\n3. Caution should be taken when interpreting the results for pubs and bars because of a small sample size, sample variation and possible drop off because of some of the pubs closing down. \n\n[Download profit loss data of pubs and bars (XLSX, 11KB)][12]\n\nBy late January 2021, pubs were still reporting a larger loss of profits compared with all other businesses for the time of year. However, those losses have recently started to decrease, with around 33% of pubs recording significant profit losses, because restrictions have eased since mid-April.\n\nRecent reports confirm that the positive shift shown in our analysis has continued through the latest [unlocking of restrictions on 17 May][13]. This will be explored further in our upcoming publication on the hospitality sector, due to publish in July 2021.  \n\n##About the data\nThe indicators and analysis presented in this article are based on responses from the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS). \n\nBICS is a voluntary, fortnightly survey that captures businesses' responses on how their financial performance, workforce, prices, trade, and business resilience have been affected, over a two-week reference period. \n\nBecause of a lack of imputed data, these estimates may differ from published estimates. A detailed description of the weighting methodology can be found in the recently published [Quality and Methodology information report][14].\n\nBICS responses were sifted by their Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code. SIC Code \"56302: Public houses and bars\" is used to capture \"Pubs\" and any other respondent is classified under \"All other businesses\".\n\nThe quotes used in the article are derived from the free-text responses within BICS. Sentiment analysis has been carried out and the responses have been summarised and rephrased to safeguard the anonymity of the respondents.\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">\n###Previous Economies of ale publications\n[Economies of ale: small pubs close as chains focus on big bars, November 2018][15]\n\n[Economies of ale: changes in the UK pubs and bars sector, 2001 to 2019, January 2020][16]\n</ons-box>\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52012432\n  [2]: https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/timeline-lockdown-web.pdf\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/businessservices/articles/insightsofthebusinessimpactofcoronaviruscovid19survey/24august2020to4april2021\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1401/confidence/datadownload.xlsx\n  [5]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021/covid-19-response-spring-2021-summary\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/articles/economiesofalesmallpubscloseaschainsfocusonbigbars/changesintheukpubsandbarssector2001to2019\n  [7]: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54435065\n  [8]: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wages-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1401/furlough/datadownload.xlsx\n  [10]: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/full-list-of-local-restriction-tiers-by-area\n  [11]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-announces-national-lockdown\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1401/furlough/datadownload.xlsx\n  [13]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/further-easing-of-covid-restrictions-confirmed-for-17-may\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/methodologies/businessinsightsandconditionssurveybicsqmi\n  [15]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/articles/economiesofalesmallpubscloseaschainsfocusonbigbars/2018-11-26\n  [16]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/articles/economiesofalesmallpubscloseaschainsfocusonbigbars/changesintheukpubsandbarssector2001to2019"

This means at least 80% of visits to friends and relatives would now require quarantine and COVID-19 tests on return to the UK.  The UK government is telling people they should not travel to countries on the red or amber lists. \n\nThe true figure will be higher because the red, amber and green lists include countries where data on visits are grouped due to small numbers. These are listed in the data as, for example, “Other Africa”, “Other Asia”, etc. Visits to see friends and relatives in these groups of countries came to an average of just over 684,000 each summer, accounting for around 10% of visits for this purpose. \n\nThe nations of the UK have their own red, amber and green lists, which are currently identical. People who visit countries on green lists do not have to quarantine on returning to the UK. However, other countries also have their own restrictions on whether or not they would allow UK residents to visit, including with or without quarantine. \n\nThe Republic of Ireland is the only country in the top 20 for visiting friends and relatives where quarantine is not required on returning to the UK. This is because it is part of the Common Travel Area, along with the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. \n\nBetween 2016 and 2019, [29% of all overseas residents’ visits to the UK][3] during Quarter 3 were to visit friends and relatives while 23% of UK residents’ visits to other countries were for the same reason.  \n\nThis made visiting friends and relatives the second most common reason for foreign travel, after holidays. Around 44% of overseas residents’ visits to the UK was for holidays compared with 69% of UK residents’ visits overseas. \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1408/visits_total/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Nearly five times as many visits are normally made to amber list Spain as are made to Ireland\"/>\n\n[Data for top 20 countries for total visits by UK residents (XLSX, 18 KB)][4]\n\nUK residents made an average of 6.3 million visits to Spain, for any reason (holidays, visiting friends and relatives, business or study) during Quarter 3 between 2016 and 2019. This made Spain by far the most popular summer destination for UK residents. \n\nThe second most popular was France, with 3.6 million visits. Both countries are on the amber list as of 8 June 2021. \n\nAustralia is the most popular destination on the current green list, with an average of 99,000 visits by UK residents during a non-pandemic summer. The most popular destination previously on the green list was Portugal, with an average of 1.2 million visits by UK residents each third quarter. Portugal was removed from the green list with effect from 8 June 2021.   \n\nIn 2020, as the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in travel restrictions, [UK residents made an estimated 23.8 million visits abroad][5], a fall of 74% on the year before. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1408/visits_fr/datadownload.xlsx\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/leisureandtourism/articles/traveltrends/2019/relateddata\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/leisureandtourism/datasets/overseasresidentsvisitstotheuk\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1408/visits_total/datadownload.xlsx\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/leisureandtourism/articles/overseastravelandtourism2020/2021-05-24"

Using monthly data, the periods above average were from March to July 2020 and then from September 2020 to March 2021. \n\nExcess deaths are the clearest way to compare the likely impact of the pandemic over time, because a substantial number of non-COVID-19 excess deaths were recorded early in the pandemic, in March and April 2020.

Figures are based on the date of death registration, rather than death occurrence. \n\nThe first peak in coronavirus deaths was in April 2020, while the country was in the middle of the first national lockdown. At this time, urban centres in London, Birmingham, the north of England and South Wales had the highest rates of deaths due to any cause. \n\nThere were many reasons why certain communities experienced high death rates, with more deaths due to COVID-19 in the [most deprived areas of England and Wales than in the least deprived areas][3]. \n\nThere were also higher death rates [among some ethnic minority groups][4] as well as in [males][5] and [those with pre-existing conditions][6]. There have also been higher death rates among people with [jobs with regular exposure to COVID-19][7]. \n\nAlthough overall deaths in England and Wales reduced during the summer of 2020, in some areas of northern England, such as Tameside and Blackburn with Darwen, mortality rates were higher than normal. \n\nThe autumn and winter of 2020 saw mortality rates peak in different local areas in different months. In November 2020, mortality rates were highest in Rochdale and Blaenau Gwent and in December 2020 parts of Lincolnshire such as Lincoln and Boston recorded their highest mortality rates of the pandemic. \n\nAs 2021 began with a third national lockdown, there were many areas in both England and Wales with high mortality rates; with the area from Essex to East London to East Sussex suffering due to the spread of the Alpha COVID-19 variant, first identified in Kent.  \n\nIn January 2021, the mortality rate in England was highest in Barking and Dagenham. In Wales, the highest was in Bridgend.  \n\nOn average, overall mortality rates in England and Wales declined in February 2021, although in some areas they were only reaching their peak. These areas included Copeland, Great Yarmouth, Bolsover and Norwich. In March 2021, Blackpool had the highest ASMR in England and Wales, but this was below its April 2020 peak. \n\nSince March 2021, deaths in England and Wales returned to average or near to average for the time of year, although deaths due to COVID-19 increased again in July. \n\n \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsduetocovid19bylocalareaanddeprivation\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1501/lamortality-time/data/datadownload.xlsx\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsduetocovid19bylocalareaanddeprivation\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/updatingethniccontrastsindeathsinvolvingthecoronaviruscovid19englandandwales/24january2020to31march2021\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19andthedifferenteffectsonmenandwomenintheukmarch2020tofebruary2021/2021-03-10\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/monthlymortalityanalysisenglandandwales/april2021#pre-existing-conditions-of-people-whose-death-was-due-to-covid-19-deaths-registered-in-january-to-march-quarter-1-2021\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyoccupationenglandandwales/deathsregisteredbetween9marchand28december2020"

      "markdown": "We take it for granted now that you have a flushing toilet at home but in 1961, indoor toilets were much less common. \n\nThe census that year asked if people had a toilet inside or attached to the home they were living in. Nearly 7% of households in England and Wales did not. \n\nOutdoor toilets could be in a separate building in the garden, or in some cases, a communal toilet for the street.  \n\nIn some rural districts, more than half of households had a toilet separate from their property. \n\nOf the 1961 districts with the highest proportion of homes without inside or attached toilets, the top 50 were all rural areas, ranging from 39% of homes without a toilet in Teifiside in Wales, to as high as 59% in the area of Mitford and Launditch in Norfolk. \n\nThe 1961 Census also asked if households had a fixed bath with waste-water plumbing. Those who didn’t have a fixed bath sometimes had a table-top or standalone bath, filled and emptied by bucket or ladle from a water heater.  \n\nYou can explore the results for both questions using the interactive maps. They display data on the map of England and Wales as it looked in 1961, so your area may look different to how it is today. The letters after place names are part of their description – a rural district (RD) is a distinct area from an urban district (UD) or a metropolitan or municipal borough (MB).\n\n####Homes without a toilet indoors or attached to the building in 1961 \n#####Explore historic census data, 1961 area boundaries\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1420/toilet/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Homes without a toilet indoors or attached to the building in 1961\"/>\n\n[Data for 1961 homes without toilets (XLSX, 85KB)][1]\n\n####Homes without a fixed bath in 1961\n#####Explore historic census data, 1961 area boundaries\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1420/bath/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Homes without a fixed bath in 1961\"/>\n\n[Data for homes without a fixed bath in 1961 (XLSX, 84KB)][2]\n\nThe 1961 Census also asked about access to a cooking stove, a kitchen sink and hot water, questions that were removed on the 1981 Census.

In the 2011 Census, this had changed to 49% of people aged 16 years and over married or in a same-sex civil partnership, and 9% divorced or in a legally dissolved civil partnership. \n\nCensuses are snapshots, so they can’t tell us how many times someone has been married or in a civil partnership but the differences between these figures for 1961 and 2011 reflect a period of stark social change. \n\nBy 2011, divorce law had become less stringent, civil partnerships for same-sex couples had existed for six years and people who were separated but legally married could record this on the census, options that were not available in 1961.

Most of these areas, and the places that saw the smallest reduction in marriage, were rural, possibly because of communities being typically older. \n\nIn the rural district of Clitheroe in the North West, the proportion of people married at each census had gone up 8 percentage points, and in Blackburn rural district, marriage was up 4 percentage points.\n\n<ons-image path=\"70cded15\" />\n\nSince 2003, there has been a drop in divorce, both because of fewer people being married and people typically getting married later – marriages at older ages tend to be less likely to break up.\n\nWidows and widowers were slightly less common in 2011 than in 1961 (7% of people compared with 9%), but at a local level, around a fifth (17%) of local areas as they were in 1961 saw an increase in widowed people. \n\nSome of these areas also had some of the largest increases in population of people aged 75 years and over, such as Hunstanton urban district on the east coast of Norfolk.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1420/statusbyage/data/datadownload.xlsx"

Only 42% of households owned their own home, and in several areas of central London, home ownership was lower than 10%. \n\nBy the time of the 2011 Census, 50 years on, home ownership had risen to 64%.

In 1961, 28% of households were private rented accommodation, and 24% of households rented from a local authority or New Town corporation. \n\nThese [“New Towns”][1] were part of efforts to meet housing shortages after the Second World War by building new settlements, such as Stevenage and Crawley. The developer corporations were dissolved, and rented homes handed over to local councils, which is why the category does not exist today. \n\nThe introduction of the “Right to Buy” policy in 1980 allowed council tenants to buy the home they rented and, in some instances, council housing was replaced by properties owned by private landlords.\n\nBy 2011, only 9% of homes were rented from a local authority and 15% of homes were in private rented accommodation.\n\n####Explore home ownership changes by area\n#####Tenure type by local area in England and Wales in 1961 and 2011, 1961 boundaries\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1420/tenure/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Tenure type by local area in England and Wales in 1961 and 2011, 1961 boundaries\"/>\n\n[Data for tenure type by 1961 area compared with 2011 (XLSX, 185KB)][2]\n\n#####Notes:\n1.

In the 2011 Census, only 15% of homes were council owned. \n\nHome ownership hasn’t risen continuously in the 50 years up to 2011.

This was a result of increased life expectancy and declining birth rates. \n\nIn nearly every area of England and Wales (97%), the proportion of people aged 75 years and over increased. The places with the biggest increases in residents aged 75 years and over were mostly in coastal areas of Norfolk and Suffolk. In Hunstanton (urban district), the proportion of older people increased from 6% to 23%. \n\nThere are a few exceptions, such as in some parts of Sussex and London. In what was the municipal borough of Hove, the proportion of over-75-year-olds dropped from 11% to 7% between 1961 and 2011, and in Hastings county borough it went down from 10% to 8%.\n\n####Population has aged in most areas of England and Wales\n#####Explore 1961 areas by population age bands compared with 2011\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1420/pyramid_map/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Explore 1961 areas by population age bands compared with 2011\"/>\n\n[Data for 1961 areas by population age bands compared with 2011 (XLSX, 796KB)][1]\n\nAs the population grew, people needed more homes outside of city centres as they existed in 1961.\n\nSome of these were the [New Towns][2], which included new settlements built between 1961 and 2011. These include Milton Keynes and Northampton, which account for the local areas with the largest increases in population in the 50 years.  \n\nProportionally, the places with the biggest populations in England and Wales in 2011 were the same six urban districts as they were in 1961, as defined by historical 1961 boundaries: the cities of Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield and Bristol. \n\nOf those six urban centres, five also saw the biggest reductions in the proportion of the population of England and Wales they were home to between censuses. The city of Birmingham, as it was defined in 1961, went from housing 2.4% of the population to 1.7%.  \n\nPlaces that saw an increase in population proportion between censuses were generally areas that in 1961 were classed as rural districts. As cities spread, people moved and the New Towns were built, some of these previously rural districts became more urbanised. \n\nSee how the population has changed in an area using this interactive map.

      "markdown": "In most areas of England and Wales, people in 2011 lived in less crowded homes than in 1961, not in terms of space, but in terms of people. \n\nPeople filling out the census in 1961 and 2011 told us how many rooms they had and how many people lived in their home. \n\nWe can use this to calculate “persons per room”, where rooms include kitchens and conservatories but not bathrooms and store cupboards or corridors. \n\nOne person per room could mean one person in a single room, or 5 people in a 5-room house.  \n\nIt can’t tell us how much space each person has – one room may be a very small studio or a large kitchen-diner – but it does tell us we’re getting more spread out in how we live as households. \n\nPossible reasons for this are wide-ranging and include new housing reducing the need for multi-generational households, people having fewer children and older people living longer in family houses. \n\nNearly every local area as they were in 1961 (over 99%) has seen an increase in the number of households in that area that have 1 person per room or less, showing households have more rooms available per person to live in.\n\n<ons-image path=\"1d535572\" />\n\nThis is particularly pronounced in Kirkby urban district, which has seen a 38 percentage point (pp) increase in households with up to 1 person per room, a 27 pp reduction in households with 1 to 1.5 persons per room, and an 11 pp reduction in households with more than 1.5 persons per room.  \n\nSome areas have bucked this trend, where homes had more people per room. In a few areas, notably East Ham (Essex) county borough, Southall (Middlesex) and Leyton (Essex) municipal boroughs, there was an increase in the percentage of households that had between 1 and 1.5 persons per room compared with 1961, and also households with more than 1.5 persons per room."

However, only 4% of those who care for someone in their own home in London reported hesitancy in April to July 2021. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandvaccinehesitancygreatbritain/9august2021\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1507/mosthesitant/datadownload.xlsx"

      "markdown": "As of 19 July, [all adults aged 18 years and over in the UK had been offered at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine][1]. \n\nThe latest UK-wide data (up to 1 August 2021) show that 88.6% of the adult population has received one dose of a vaccine, with 72.7% double-vaccinated. Numbers for the four UK nations are available on the [GOV.UK coronavirus dashboard][2].  \n\nEstimates of vaccine uptake among those aged 50 years and over are available for English regions in [Public Health England’s COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring for England (CHIME) tool][3].  \n\nThe most recent data, up to the end of June 2021, show that one in nine (11%) adults aged 50 years and over in London have not received a coronavirus vaccine, twice the rate of any other English region. \n\nThe figures cover residents in England who could be linked to the 2011 Census and General Practice (GP) data. They should not be used to represent the total number of vaccinations, and may also differ from the administrative data on vaccinations published by NHS England weekly. \n\n####The rate of not receiving a vaccine among over-50s is twice as high in London as anywhere else \n#####Percentage of adults aged 50 years and over that have not received a coronavirus vaccine, English regions, end of June compared with end of March 2021\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1507/dot-plot-jiggle/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of adults aged 50 years and over that have not received a coronavirus vaccine, English regions, end of June compared with end of March 2021\"/>\n\n[Data on adults aged 50 years and over that have not received a coronavirus vaccine (XLSX, 18KB)][4]\n\nAmong ethnic groups, the highest rate of not receiving a vaccine was in London for Black Caribbean adults (32%) and West Midlands for those of Black African ethnicity (30%). \n\nThose who have never worked and are long-term unemployed were more likely to have not had a vaccine than those in employment. The highest rate of non-vaccination was in London (21%). \n\nJust as rates of vaccine hesitancy increase with levels of deprivation, the likelihood of not having a vaccine also rises in more deprived areas across all English regions. Around one in six (17%) over-50s living in the most deprived parts of London had not received a vaccine by the end of June 2021 (the highest of any region). \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/every-adult-in-uk-offered-covid-19-vaccine\n  [2]: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/vaccinations\n  [3]: https://analytics.phe.gov.uk/apps/chime/\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1507/dot-plot-jiggle/datadownload.xlsx"
