On 16 March 2020, [people were told to work from home wherever possible][1] while everyone was told to “avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues”, to try to curb the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).  \n\nA week later, on 23 March 2020, the UK’s first lockdown would begin. From deaths and the pressure on hospitals, to the number of hours worked and people’s expectations of rising unemployment, we can see how the remarkable figures recorded over the past 12 months compare with others and made this a year like no other. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-16-march-2020"

Figures include deaths of non-residents. \n2. Deaths are based on date a death was registered rather than occurred. \n3. All figures for 2020 are provisional. \n4. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD): ICD 1 to 9 codes are [available at the National Archives][1]; ICD-10: Infectious and parasitic diseases (A00-B99). \n5. Deaths data in this chart do not include influenza or pneumonia, which are classed as respiratory infections (J09-J18).\n\n[Download the data][2]\n\nMore than 140,000 people have now died in the UK with COVID-19 mentioned as the underlying cause or a contributory cause on their death certificates. \n\nThis includes more than 73,500 people in England and Wales whose deaths were due to COVID-19 — where it was the underlying cause — registered in 2020. Almost 4,400 further deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases were registered in 2020. COVID-19 is likely to be classed as an infectious and parasitic disease, following the precedent of similar diseases such as previous coronavirus strains (before COVID-19) and other viral infections.  \n\nThis means COVID-19 was the underlying cause of more deaths in 2020 than any other infectious and parasitic diseases had caused in any year since 1918; that year there were just over 89,900 deaths from various infectious and parasitic diseases registered in England and Wales. \n\nMore recently, there were nearly 8,200 deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases in England and Wales in 2007. This coincided with a peak in deaths in England [involving Clostridium difficile (C. difficile)][3]. \n\nThis analysis uses causes of death defined as “infectious or parasitic diseases” in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), published by the World Health Organisation (WHO). This means it does not include deaths from influenza and pneumonia, which are categorised separately as respiratory infections.\nComparisons of deaths involving COVID-19 and those involving influenza and pneumonia [in England and Wales during the pandemic can be found in our weekly releases][4].\n\nOther nations’ deaths data are published by the [Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency][6] and [National Records of Scotland][7]. \n\n\n  [1]: https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20151014074732tf_/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/subnational-health1/the-20th-century-mortality-files/20th-century-deaths/index.html\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1214/datadownloads/fig1_deaths.csv\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingclostridiumdifficileenglandandwales/2013-08-22\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/latest\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/latest\n  [6]: https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/weekly-deaths\n  [7]: https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/general-publications/weekly-and-monthly-data-on-births-and-deaths/deaths-involving-coronavirus-covid-19-in-scotland"

The breakdown by industry sector for Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2009 onwards is not entirely consistent with those of previous quarters following methodology changes. The effect of these changes on the time series is significant for some of the industry sectors shown.  No adjustments have been made to the average hours series to account for the effects of the changes. Further information is available in the data download. \n4. This analysis uses the established estimates for actual hours rather than the experimental imputation which suggests the impact on hours may have been even stronger than those reported here. \n\n[Download the data][1]\n\nWith up to 8.9 million people on furlough and many businesses unable to trade as normal during lockdown, [the average number of hours worked in the UK][2] per person per week fell to 25.9 in April to June 2020, compared with 32.3 in the same three months of 2019.  This was the lowest since January to March 2008, when average weekly working hours were 30.9 per person. \n\nAccommodation and food services industries, which included people furloughed from closed pubs, hotels and restaurants, recorded a 54% fall in average weekly hours worked in April to June 2020, with 13.0 hours per worker on average compared with 28.4 in the same three months of 2019. Other industries saw less significant falls. For example, in financial, insurance and real estate services, where many workers were likely to be able to do so from home, the average in April to June 2020 was down 6% on the same period of 2019.  \n\nBy October to December 2020, average weekly hours worked had increased but were still down by 7% overall on the same period of 2019, with accommodation and food services down 33% as they were affected by lockdown measures, the tier system in England and rules on the numbers of people allowed to meet indoors. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1214/datadownloads/fig3_hours_worked.csv\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/averagehoursworkedbyindustryhour03"

The data are in current prices and have not been adjusted for inflation. \n\nCertain commodities also saw significant year-on-year falls in imports and exports following the start of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. \n\nFuel imports in the three months ending July 2020 were down by 58.5% on the equivalent period of 2019 followed by a 41.3% year-on-year fall in the three months to October 2020.

      "markdown": "<ons-chart path=\"3e759414\" />\n\nThe average UK house price reached a record high of £252,000 in December 2020 — an increase of 8.5% over the year.  \n\nAverage house prices increased in 2020 despite the significant fall in gross domestic product (GDP) during the first lockdown. This differed from the 2008 and 2009 economic downturn, where GDP and house prices both fell year on year. \n\nThis may reflect differences in the cause of each downturn. The 2008 to 2009 economic downturn was because of structural issues with financing mortgages. The fall in house prices in 2008 and 2009 reflects the impacts of the financial crisis on the cost and availability of finance, including for mortgages. Whereas the fall in GDP in 2020 was possibly driven more by reduced opportunities to spend, caused by lockdown restrictions, rather than primarily a lack of funds. \n\nThe [latest house price data, published on GOV.UK by HM Land Registry][1], may reflect the pent-up demand — from people who had been unable to buy during the lockdown — and changes to the types of property people wanted. In the UK House Price Index (HPI) data the average price of detached properties increased by 10.0% in the year to December 2020, compared with a 5.0% rise for flats and maisonettes. \n\nDuring the first lockdown, analysis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed [one in eight households (12%) in Great Britain had no garden][2].   \n\nGovernment support schemes may also explain some of the rise in house prices while GDP declined. [Stamp Duty was suspended][3] on the first £500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland from July 2020 until the end of June 2021. In Wales, the threshold for paying the Land Transaction Tax was raised from £180,000 to £250,000 until 30 June 2021. In Scotland, the threshold for starting to pay the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax was raised from £145,000 to £250,000 until 31 March 2021.
