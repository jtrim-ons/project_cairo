      "markdown": "###Film and TV growth driven by production\n\nWhen we break down the film and television industry into its component parts, we can see that it’s production – the preparation and shooting of movies and TV programmes – that has grown the most in recent years. In 2016 it contributed more than £2.5 billion to the UK economy.\n\n####Breakdown of Gross Value Added (GVA) in film, video and television companies, 2008 to 2016\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc468/breakdown/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Breakdown of Gross Value Added (GVA) in film, video and television companies, 2008 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data][1]\n\nDistribution, which includes licensing films and television programmes and managing rights, contributed more than £3.5 billion in 2016 – almost three times as much as it did in 2008. We’ve seen that the contribution to the economy from film distribution can vary a lot from month to month, suggesting that payments from licensing agreements from media companies around the world are paid according to a quarterly schedule.\n\nThe growth in post-production (editing, graphics, sound and visual effects) and projection (showing films in cinemas) is not as dramatic, but still significant.\n\n\n  [1]: https://staic.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/12/data-1.csv"

      "markdown": "###Tax relief for films\nThe Creative Industries Tax Reliefs, introduced initially for film in 2007 and later expanded to support high-end TV, video games, animation and children’s programmes, appear to have played a major part in attracting big-budget productions to the UK.\n\nFilm Tax Relief allows film production companies to claim a cash rebate of up to 25% of the money they spend making the film in the UK (up to a maximum of 80% of the film’s core expenditure).\n\nFor a film to qualify as “British” for tax purposes, it either has to pass a “cultural test” based on how much of the story, setting, production and crew are British (or from the European Economic Area), or be an official co-production from a country which has a reciprocal agreement with the UK or through the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-production.\n\nIn the last decade the British Film Institute (BFI) has certified almost 2,000 films in this way, including many blockbusters.\n\n<ons-table path=\"fad15c1e\" />\n\nSince 2007, HMRC have paid £2.3 billion of Film Tax Relief, representing almost £9 billion spent on making films in the UK. The full spend on film production in the UK since 2007 is £12.2 billion according to the BFI; this includes films which have not yet been given final certification as British.\n\n####Amount of Film Tax Relief paid (receipts basis), 2007-08 to 2016-17\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc468/tax/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Amount of Film Tax Relief paid (receipts basis), 2007-08 to 2016-17\"/>\n\n[Download the data][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/12/data-2.csv"
