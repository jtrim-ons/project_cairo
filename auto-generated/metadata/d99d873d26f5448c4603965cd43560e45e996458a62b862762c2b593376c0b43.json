But what do ONS population estimates tell us about how this might change the voting population?\n\nIn 2015, the most recent year for which we have constituency-level population estimates, there were 1.5 million 16- and 17-year-olds in the UK. They would have made up 2.87% of the population aged 16 and over.\n###Which areas might have been affected during the 2017 general election?\nOverall there were 88 constituencies^2^ where the number of 16- and 17-year-olds^3^ was greater than the winning margin. This doesn’t mean that the outcome in the seats would have changed, that would depend on voter turnout and preference, but it does show us those areas where there would have been potential for change.\n\nFour of the 10 constituencies with the smallest margins were in Scotland, with the constituencies of North East Fife, Perth and North Perthshire, Glasgow South West and Glasgow East all with a majority of 75 or less.\n\n####Constituencies where the 16- and 17-year-old population was greater than the winning margin, UK, 2017\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc422/wherepercentgreatermargin/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Constituencies where the 16- and 17-year-old population was greater than the winning margin, UK, 2017\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][4]\n\nIn fact there were 19 constituencies in Scotland where the 16- and 17-year-old population is higher than the margin in 59 constituencies (32%). This compares with 22% of constituencies in Northern Ireland, 17.5% in Wales, and 10.5% in England.\n\n####Proportion of seats with 16- and 17-year-old population greater than winning margin, UK, 2017 \n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc422/seatschart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of seats with 16- and 17-year-old population greater than winning margin, UK, 2017\"/>Source: [ONS][5], [NRS][6], [NISRA][7], [House of Commons Library][8]\n\n[Download the data.][9]\n###Which areas would have the greatest share of 16- and 17-year-old voters?\nOf course the areas with the tightest margins will change from election to -election, so another way to look at this is to explore the areas with the largest proportion of 16- and 17-year-olds. The proportion of 16- and 17-year-olds in the population age 16 and over might give us a sense of this population's potential to influence the election outcome.\n\nHowever, care must be taken in using these data to assess the potential impact on election outcomes as these population estimates include some people who are not eligible to vote (for example foreign nationals) and exclude some people who are eligible to vote (for example overseas electors).\n\nBirmingham and Bradford had the largest proportion of 16- and 17-year-olds, as a share of those aged 16 and over. The Birmingham Hodge Hill constituency stood at almost 5% (4.85%), followed by Bradford West (4.38%), Bradford East (4.21%) and Birmingham, Hall Green.\n\n####Proportion of 16- and 17-year-olds in population aged 16 and over, UK, 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc422/votingpercent/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of 16- and 17-year-olds in population aged 16 and over, UK, 2015\"/>Source: [ONS][10], [NRS][11], [NISRA][12]\n\n[Download the data.][13]\n\nThe smallest proportions of 16- and 17-year-olds were found in Battersea (1.48%), Glasgow North (1.54%) and Glasgow Central (1.58%).\n\n\n####Timeline of UK electoral change\n\nThe Great Reform Act of 1832 introduced voter registration, broadened those who could vote (although the working class largely remained ineligible to vote), and created new seats in England and Wales.\n\nPrior to the Great Reform Act, voting was limited by the fact that two-thirds of MPs stood for election in uncontested seats, meaning for much of the country, voting was not even possible.\n\nIn 1867 another Great Reform Act extended the vote to all householders, which gave the vote to many working class men who had previously been excluded from voting. It was not until the 20th century that significant changes were made to electoral law that dramatically changed the number of people who were eligible to vote.\n\nBy 1908, the vote was limited to men over 21 who “paid rates” or owned property. This is estimated at about 60% of the adult male population.\n\nThe Representation of the People Act 1918 extended the vote so there was no longer a property qualification for men. More famously, perhaps, it extended the vote to women at parliamentary elections, though this was limited to those over 30, and the property qualification still applied to them.\n\nThe 1918 Act added 13.7m women and 5.3m men to the electorate. Had women been given the vote on equal terms with men, as they eventually were in 1928, they would have been in the majority, due to loss of men during the war.\n\nFull electoral equality was not achieved until 1928, and the franchise as we know it today did not emerge until 1969, when the voting age was reduced from 21 to 18.\n\nIn 2015 a bill allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in the Scottish and local government elections has been passed unanimously at Holyrood.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[How inflation changes how much your wages are worth][14]\n\n[What's changed since the Brexit vote?][15]\n\n[What's affects an area's life expectancy?][16]\n\n\n\nIf you like our Visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up][17] to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: <better.info@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n  [1]: #timeline\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/votechart.csv\n  [3]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39921090/will-the-voting-age-ever-be-lowered-to-16\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/marginmap.csv\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/parliamentaryconstituencymidyearpopulationestimates\n  [6]: https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/population-estimates/2011-based-special-area-population-estimates/spc-population-estimates\n  [7]: https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/2015-mid-year-population-estimates-northern-ireland\n  [8]: http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7979\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/seatschart.csv\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/parliamentaryconstituencymidyearpopulationestimates\n  [11]: https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/population/population-estimates/2011-based-special-area-population-estimates/spc-population-estimates\n  [12]: https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/2015-mid-year-population-estimates-northern-ireland\n  [13]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/16votemap.csv\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/howinflationchangeshowmuchyourwagesareworth/2017-06-26\n  [15]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/articles/whatschangedsincethebrexitvote/2017-06-23\n  [16]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/hipstersginandthebasketofgoods/2017-03-14\n  [17]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n\n\n\n####Footnotes:\n\n1.
