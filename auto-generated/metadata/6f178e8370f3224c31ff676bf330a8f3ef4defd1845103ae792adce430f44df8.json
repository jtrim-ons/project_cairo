On the other hand, men are more likely to tolerate a longer journey to work in return for higher pay.\n\nThis combination contributes to men doing the majority of high-paid jobs, which in turn contributes to the overall gender pay gap.\n\n####Women place more emphasis on their commute when deciding whether to leave their job…\n#####Impact of commute time on probability of leaving current job, Great Britain, 2004 to 2018\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc659/hazards/commute-time/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Commute Time\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3]\n\n####…while men consider pay to be more important\n#####Impact of pay on probability of leaving current job, Great Britain, 2004 to 2018\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc659/hazards/earnings/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Earnings\"/>\n\n[Download the data][4]\n\nNotes:\n\n1.

      "markdown": "For both sexes, longer commutes are associated with higher pay and shorter commutes with lower pay. \n\nYet women still favour short commutes (15 minutes or fewer), while [men do the majority of longer journeys to work][1] (an hour or more). \n\nThis could be because women are less likely to own a car than men – [they owned around one-third of cars on UK roads in 2017][2] – potentially making them reliant on other means such as public transport (which tends to be slower). But many people who do not own a car still have access to one, and [our data show that car journeys to work are more or less equally split between men and women][3].\n\nMore likely, women prefer short commutes because they do more childcare and unpaid work.\n\nThis is reinforced by the gender commuting gap, which follows exactly the same age-pattern as the gender pay gap. Both open up as people reach their mid to late 20s, [implying a link with having children][4] (the average age of a first-time mother was 28.8 years in 2017). \n\nUpon reaching this age, women begin to sacrifice their longer commutes, bringing their average travel time down while average pay plateaus. In the meantime, men maintain their longer commutes while their pay continues to rise.\n\n####The commuting gap and the pay gap both widen when people start having children\n#####Median commute time and hourly earnings by sex and single year of age, Great Britain, 2010 to 2018\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc659/small-multiples/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Commute time and Earnings\"/>\n\n[Download the data][5]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/thecommutinggapmenaccountfor65ofcommuteslastingmorethananhour/2018-11-07\n  [2]: https://www.smmt.co.uk/2018/04/female-car-owners-up-20-in-a-decade-reveals-uks-biggest-automotive-motorparc-analysis/\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/commutingtoworkbygenderukcountryandregion\n  [4]: https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/13673\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc659/small-multiples/datadownload.csv"

      "title": "What about regional differences?",
      "markdown": "The age-pattern of commutes is largely the same regardless of where people live. Men travel for longer than women to get to work, particularly after reaching their late 20s.\n \nAmong people aged under 30, men commute for longer than women in all but one of the 20 most populated travel-to-work areas in Great Britain. But the differences are small, no more than two or three minutes.\n\nWhen we look at over 30s, the difference between men and women widens in all 20 areas, matching the trend seen across the country as a whole. \n\nThis trend is most pronounced in Guildford and Aldershot, an area within commuting distance of London. Under 30s living here travel to work for around 20 minutes on average, regardless of sex. While the average commute remains unchanged for women aged over 30, it increases by more than 50% for men. \n\nThis divergence could be partly driven by families moving out of London to Guildford and Aldershot, with men more likely than women to continue working in the capital.\n\n####The commuting gap does not discriminate by area\n#####Average commute times in the 20 most populated travel-to-work areas, by sex, 2010 to 2018 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc659/region/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The commuting gap does not discriminate by area\"/>\n\n[Download the data][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc659/region/datadownload.csv"
