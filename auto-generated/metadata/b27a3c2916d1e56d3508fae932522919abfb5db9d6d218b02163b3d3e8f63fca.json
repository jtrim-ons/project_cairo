(Sources:  BRES 2014, ONS). Britain's biggest steel producer, the Indian firm Tata, employs 17,000 in the UK, according to press reports.\n\n(BRES, 2015 is due to be published in September 2016.)\n\nThe 1971 census of employment recorded 323,000 steel workers, representing 1.5% of all in employment. By 1981 this had almost halved to 167,000 (0.8%)\n\nThe decline in employment is particularly noticeable between the late 1970s and mid 1980s, with the biggest drop recorded between 1978 and 1981, when employment fell from 271,000 to 167,000.\n\nDuring this time there were national strikes, employment reform and many plant closures such as those in [County Durham][2], [Northampton][3] and [Shotton][4].\n\nThe British Steel Corporation - a nationalised industry until 1988 - had been closing its outdated and loss-making plants to improve productivity amid [losses in the region of £145million.][5]\n\nEmployment in the steel industry fell below 100,000 in the late 1980s and, after that, declined gradually throughout the 1990s and 2000s, reaching 37,000 in 2008.\n\nAfter a dip related to the 2008-2009 economic downturn, steel industry employment recovered slightly to 34,500 in 2014.\n\nMore than 4,000 job closures in the British steel industry have been announced since September 2015, according to reports in the media, including [BBC News][6].\n###Employment in the steel industry by region\nThe distribution of employment in the steel industry across Great Britain is significantly different from that of employment in all industries. Its relative importance, jobs-wise is strongest in Yorkshire and the Humber, in Wales and in the North-East. Together these three regions contained 67% of steel industry employment in 2014 but only 16% of total employment.\n\n####Regional distribution of employment in the steel industry compared with total employment, 2014\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc303/chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Regional distributionÂ� of employment in the steel industry compared with total employment, 2014\"/>[Download the data][7]\n###Increasing productivity\nWhile employment has decreased to about one tenth of its 1970s peak, total steel industry output has fallen by only about a half over the same period. This mainly reflects increased productivity, which had broadly increased five-fold during that time.\n\n####Steel production in Great Britain, 1900 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc303/chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Steel production in Great Britain, 1900 to 2015\"/>[Download the data][8]\n\nData provided by the International Steel Statistics Bureau are used directly in the estimation of steel industry output in the ONS's monthly Index of Production. These data (which are not seasonally adjusted) indicated that the UK produced 9.5 million metric tons in 2011, the lowest crude steel production tonnage since the 1930s.\n\nThe output of the steel industry (gross value added) was £2.2bn in 2014 (current prices) (ONS, National Accounts). This represented 0.1% of the figure for all industries. This represents a decline from 1990, when it made up 0.5% of total output (ONS, National Accounts).\n###Export of steel\nAccording to UK Trade, November 2015, the UK exported £6.1 billion of iron and steel in 2014. In the same year the UK imported almost as much iron and steel, though, with £5.9 billion coming in.\n\nIn 2013, the UK exported £6.1 billion in iron and steel and imported £5.3 billion.\n\nFor more information, please contact: <digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk>\n\n####Footnotes\n\n1. The employment figures in this report are for employees plus working owners. They therefore include those self-employed workers who are registered for VAT or Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) schemes. Self-employed people who are not registered for these, along with HM Forces and government-supported trainees are not included.\n\n2. Definition of the steel industry in this analysis.\n\nEmployment within the steel industry can be traced back to 1971 via data from the:\n\nCensus of Employment (1971-1981 (SIC 1968), 1981-1991 (SIC 1980))<br>\nAnnual Employment Survey (1991-1998 (SIC 1992))<br>\nAnnual Business Inquiry (1998-2008 (SIC 2003))<br>\nBusiness Register and Employment Survey (BRES) (2009-2014 (SIC 2007))<br>\n\nWhile employment data are available from 1971, due to changes in the Standard Industrial Classifications (SIC), the definition of the steel industry may slightly change between surveys. Moreover, due to methodological changes between surveys there exists discontinuities. Hence caution should be used when comparing data across years.\n\n#####Definitions used to represent the steel industry:\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:top}\n</style>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n  <tr>\n    <th class=\"tg-031e\">Years</th>\n    <th class=\"tg-031e\">Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)</th>\n    <th class=\"tg-031e\">SIC codes used</th>\n    <th class=\"tg-031e\">SIC descriptions</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">1971-1981</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">SIC 1968</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">311<br>312</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">Iron and Steel (General)<br>Steel tubes</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">1981-1991</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">SIC 1980</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">2210<br>2220<br>2230</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">Iron and steel industry<br>Steel tubes<br>Drawing, Cold Rolling and Cold Forming of Steel</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">1991-1998</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">SIC 1992</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">27.1<br>27.2<br>27.3</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-031e\">Manufacture of basic iron and steel and of ferro-alloys<br>Manufacture of tubes<br>\n Other first processing of iron and steel and production of non-ECSC ferro-alloys</td>\n</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">1998-2008</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">SIC 2003</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">27.1<br><br>27.2<br>27.3</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Manufacture of basic iron and steel and of ferro-alloys<br>Manufacture of tubes<br>Other first processing of iron and steel</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">2009-2014</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">SIC 2007</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">24.1<br><br>24.2<br><br>24.3</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-yw4l\">Manufacture of basic iron and steel and of ferro-alloys<br>Manufacture of tubes, pipes, hollow profiles and related fittings, of steel<br>Manufacture of other products of first processing of steel</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n<br>\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/11/figure12.csv\n  [2]: http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/lifestyle/nostalgia/remember-when-consett-steelworks-1980-7568430\n  [3]: http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/northampton/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8715000/8715706.stm\n  [4]: http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/northeastwales/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8596000/8596684.stm\n  [5]: http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/2/newsid_2478000/2478393.stm\n  [6]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-35339153\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/11/figure21.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/01/figure41.csv\n \n"
