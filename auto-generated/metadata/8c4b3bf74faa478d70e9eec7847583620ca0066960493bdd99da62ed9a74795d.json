This has been attributed to a mixture of poor weather conditions and high oil prices across the world, which increased the global prices of farmed foods.\n\nThe growth of food prices hit a plateau in the UK in 2014, when discount shops such as Aldi and Lidl gained popularity. A supermarket price war began, with rival retailers slowing price growth to keep customers and remain competitive.\n\n####Liquid fuels\nThe price of liquid fuels, such as oil, increased by 49% in the UK over the period 2007 to 2008. This was due to growing demand driving a worldwide increase in price over the same period. Prices peaked in July 2008, but as the financial downturn hit the global economy, fuel prices plummeted after a matter of months. Between July and December 2008, they had fallen 42%.\n\nPrices began recovering after 2009, peaking in early 2013, in line with improving health in the global economy. Due to a slow-down in demand from developing economies, prices dropped again in 2014, after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) refused to reduce production in order to increase prices.\n\n####Recreation and culture\nThe cost of recreation and sporting services, such as gym membership, leisure centre classes, and golf fees, increased by 53% from 2005.\n\nCultural services, such as satellite TV, music streaming subscriptions and admissions to cultural events, went up by 47% between 2005 and 2016. The highest increase in this category came from newspapers and periodicals, which went up by 65%.\n\nOne of the few areas to see a minimal change in price was in equipment for sport and open-air recreation, such as sleeping bags, fishing rods and gas barbecues. They were less than 1% below the 2005 value.\n###Price changes by category\nThe following charts allow you to look at the changing prices for goods and services by category, indexed from 2005.\n\nThis means a 50% rise in price from 2005 to 2016 would show as a line starting at 100, rising to 150 on the chart. A 50% drop in the same period would see the line drop to 50.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc404/cpih/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"CPIH\"/>\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[How inflation changes how much your wages are worth][4]\n\n[Are your wages keeping up with inflation?][5]\n\n[Hipsters, gin and the Basket of Goods][6]\n\n\n\nIf you like our Visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up][7] to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: <cpi@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/consumerpriceindicesabriefguide/2016\n  [2]: https://blog.ons.gov.uk/2017/03/20/measuring-inflation-whats-changed-and-why/\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/cpih-quiz-data.csv\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/howinflationchangeshowmuchyourwagesareworth/2017-06-26\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/areyourwageskeepingupwithinflation/2017-06-20\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/hipstersginandthebasketofgoods/2017-03-14\n  [7]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n"
