This includes one-fifth (20%) who are very worried. \n\nThe percentage that believe normal life is a year or more away was 28%, slightly more than the 25% who believed this a year ago, between 8 and 12 July 2020, but down from the peak of 41% who thought so between 16 and 20 September 2020. \n\nThe easing of restrictions differs between countries. In England, face coverings will no longer be required by law, but will be required on public transport in London and other parts of the country as a condition of travel.  \n\nIn Scotland, [restrictions are also being eased on 19 July 2021][2] but there will still be limits on how many people can meet indoors and outdoors, with one-metre physical distancing and a cap of 200 people at weddings and funerals. Face coverings will also continue to be required.  \n\n[In Wales, from 17 July 2021][3] up to six people will be allowed to meet indoors, and indoor events will be permitted for up to 1,000 people seated and up to 200 standing. Most other restrictions in Wales will be lifted from 7 August. However, face coverings will still be required in most indoor public spaces, except for hospitality businesses. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/16july2021\n  [2]: https://www.gov.scot/news/level-0-from-19-july/\n  [3]: https://gov.wales/next-steps-towards-future-fewer-covid-rules-first-minister"
