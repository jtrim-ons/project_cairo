Figures include deaths of non-residents. \n\n2. Based on the date a death was registered rather than the date a death occurred. \n\n3. All figures for 2020 are provisional. \n\n4. The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD-10) definitions are as follows: coronavirus (COVID-19) (U07.1 and U07.2). \n\n5. [Statistics on death registrations are updated weekly][1]. \n\nCOVID-19 has been mentioned on 69,771 death certificates in England and Wales in the year to 4 December 2020 (end of week 49). This is 12.3% of all deaths for that period. \n\nThe 428,306 total deaths registered – from all causes – since the week ending 27 March (week 13) were about 20% (71,167) higher than the average for the same period over the previous five years. \n  \nAs of 4 December there had been 1,480 [COVID-19-related deaths registered in Northern Ireland][3], with total deaths since the week ending 27 March 17% above the five-year average. As of 6 December, there have been 5,868 [deaths involving COVID-19 registered in Scotland][4]. \n \nDeaths exceeded their five-year average in age groups 15 years and over. The biggest increase was in those aged 85 to 89 years, with three-quarters of deaths involving COVID-19 in people aged 75 years and over. \n\nThere is evidence that the death rate and infection rate for most ethnic minority groups are higher compared with white ethnic groups. This link is very complex and could be explained by [many socio-economic and environmental factors][5]. The Office for National Statistics has published [a detailed analysis][6] on the social impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on people from different ethnic groups in the UK. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/latest\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1104/fig3/datadownload.xlsx\n  [3]: https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/weekly-deaths\n  [4]: https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/general-publications/weekly-and-monthly-data-on-births-and-deaths/deaths-involving-coronavirus-covid-19-in-scotland\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/whyhaveblackandsouthasianpeoplebeenhithardestbycovid19/2020-12-14\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/ethnicity/articles/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsondifferentethnicgroupsintheuk/2020"

Car, light commercial vehicle and HGV use is a percentage of the equivalent in the first week of February.\n2. Rail is the percentage of the equivalent week in 2019.\n3. Bus use is the percentage of the third week of January 2020.\n4. Cycling data are for England only and is highly variable owing to weather and daylight conditions and is based on comparison with one day in the first week of March.\n5. National Rail data are subject to revisions up to a week after initial publication. The latest days data would be an underestimate of the final result as the raw ticket sales data matures. Since 16 September 2020, DfT has applied an adjustment to the latest data to attempt to account for this.\n\nTo reduce the spread of the coronavirus, the UK began a full nationwide lockdown on 23 March 2020, with non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and venues closed, people instructed to stay at home as much as possible and to only to go out for limited reasons, such as to exercise. \n\nCycling, measured by usage in England, was the only mode of transport to record a rise during the first full lockdown, [according to data from the Department for Transport (DfT)][1].  \n\nIt has since declined to below March levels, however, the colder and wetter months would normally result in a decrease.  \n\nAs many workers followed the stay at home instruction, rail use in April and May fell to as low as 4% of February levels. \n\nTransport use dipped again during the second period of nationwide restrictions in Wales from 23 October to 9 November and in England from 5 November to 2 December. Usage across Great Britain has since risen, although remains below the levels from before the first lockdown. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/transport-use-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic"

Data are weekly totals for weeks commencing Monday. 2020 dates have been aligned with equivalent dates in 2019.\n\nFor air travel, the year started like it had in 2019 with very little difference in arrivals during January and February. As the coronavirus spread, the UK government [advised against all non-essential foreign travel][1] on 17 March 2020. In April, arrivals were 1% of their 2019 level, according to data from [the Home Office][2]. \n\nHealth measures were introduced at UK borders in June and July, which saw the introduction of International Travel Corridors. This contributed to an increase in arrivals from late June, but with arrivals still only at about a quarter of the levels seen in 2019. There were around 1.7 million passenger arrivals to the UK by air routes in October 2020, which is around 18% of October 2019 levels, when there were 9.8 million arrivals.  \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/travel-advice-foreign-secreatary-statement-17-march-2020\n  [2]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statistics-relating-to-passenger-arrivals-since-the-covid-19-outbreak-november-2020"

Final unweighted results, Wave 2 to Wave 6 (before June), and final weighted results, Wave 7 to Wave 19, of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Business Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Survey (BICS).\n2. Weighted data are available from Wave 7 (1 June to 14 June) onwards only. The sample redesign in Wave 7 improves our coverage for the small-sized businesses, allowing for weighted results to be truly reflective of all businesses. Comparisons between these periods should be treated with caution.\n3. Businesses were asked for their experiences for the reference period. However, for questions regarding the last two weeks, businesses may respond from the point of completion of the questionnaire.\n4. Percentages are from businesses that had not permanently stopped trading.\n\nFrom April 2020, millions of UK workers whose employers were unable to continue trading at the same levels as before the lockdown were supported by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, also known as furlough. \n\nThe ONS Business Impact of Coronavirus Survey (BICS) Wave 7 found 30% of workers across businesses that had not permanently stopped trading were on furlough leave between 1 June and 14 June 2020. \n\nWith theatres, cinemas and other venues closed, the arts, entertainment and recreation sector had furloughed 71% of workers in early June. The accommodation and food service sector – affected by the limiting of pubs and restaurants to takeaway only – had 69% of staff on furlough at the same time. \n\nThe proportion of the workforce on furlough leave gradually reduced over the summer, particularly with the re-opening of the hospitality sector, reaching 8% by Wave 16 (5 to 18 October 2020). The proportion of the workforce on furlough leave has increased to 16% in Wave 19 (16 to 29 November 2020). This is likely to be as a result of new restrictions introduced over the survey period. "

[By October 2020, GDP was still down 7.9% compared with February][1] and since July 2020, there has been a loss in momentum across all main sectors.   \n\nTotal trade in goods and services, excluding precious metals fell during the first lockdown. Exports totalled £41.4 billion in May 2020 compared with £56.4 billion in the same month of 2019. Imports decreased from £58.9 billion to £38.0 billion over the same period.  \n\nBoth imports and exports grew over the summer but monthly exports figures for October were below the levels seen at the same time last year, at £48.0 billion compared with £57.4 billion respectively.

Education settings included are academies (including free schools and studio schools), local authority maintained schools (excluding local authority nursery schools), non-maintained special schools, alternative provision and university technical colleges.\n2. All figures are adjusted for non-response. This methodology has been adjusted through-out the pandemic.\n3. From March to July schools were asked to provide a count of the number of children of critical workers and the number of vulnerable children. Some children were classified as both a child of a critical worker and a vulnerable child. Some settings counted pupils as children of critical workers, but not in the count of vulnerable children. Therefore, the number of vulnerable children is an under-estimate. DfE estimates the true figure is up to 5% higher.\n4. On 25 September and 2 October, 1% of state-funded schools in England reported an inset or training day. Schools or colleges with inset or training days are considered as 'open' but not 'fully open'.\n5. From 12 October, schools were asked to exclude nursery children from their submission. A corresponding decrease was observed in submitted number on roll in schools with nurseries.\n6. [Latest data and additional footnotes and methodology can be found on the Department for Education website][1].\n\nAs the UK went into its first full lockdown in March 2020, schools sent most pupils home to learn from there. The scientific advice provided to the government at the time was that this would help to slow the spread of the coronavirus. \n\nAccording to [Department for Education data][2], in the first week of the national lockdown, 2% of students in state-funded schools in England – an average of just under 200,000 per day – were still attending. These included vulnerable children and children of key workers. \n\nBetween 7 May and 7 June 2020, 87% of parents said a [child in their household had been home-schooled][3] because of the pandemic, according to the ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey. \n\nIn June 2020, children in Reception and Year 1 and Year 6 pupils in England were able to return, followed by those in Years 10 and 12, with exams coming up. In [Wales][4], schools re-opened on 29 June, with only a third of pupils at any one time going into school, while in [Scotland][5] and [Northern Ireland][6] schools began to return in August.  \n\nSince September 2020, all students across all nations of the UK have been expected to attend school unless they had been exposed to COVID-19, were displaying symptoms or needed to be absent for other valid reasons. \n\n\n  [1]: https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/attendance-in-education-and-early-years-settings-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak\n  [2]: https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/attendance-in-education-and-early-years-settings-during-the-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/educationandchildcare/articles/coronavirusandhomeschoolingingreatbritain/apriltojune2020\n  [4]: https://gov.wales/pupils-present-maintained-schools\n  [5]: https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-daily-data-for-scotland/\n  [6]: https://www.education-ni.gov.uk/topics/statistics-and-research/management-information-relating-attendance-educational-settings-during-covid-19-outbreak"

Since then, anxiety ratings have decreased reaching a low of 3.5 in July. They rose again to just over 4 in the autumn and remained higher than pre-lockdown levels in February.\n\nLife satisfaction also decreased to its lowest score since records began in 2011, with an average 6.5 out of 10 between 28 October and 1 November, before rising to 6.8 between 10 and 13 December. \n\nIn November 2020, almost one in five (19%) adults reported experiencing some form of depression.
