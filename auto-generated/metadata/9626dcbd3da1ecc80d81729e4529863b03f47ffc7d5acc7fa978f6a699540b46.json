Some over-70s will be in this group, while others are only allowed to leave their home in [certain circumstances][2]. \n\nAs the UK population steps up national, local and community efforts to support its most vulnerable members, use our interactive map to identify which areas have the highest percentage of people aged 70 or 85 years and over. To select an area enter a postcode or hover over the map.\n\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc778/map/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Map\"/>[Download the data (zip 42.8Mb)][3]\n###### Notes:\n1.
