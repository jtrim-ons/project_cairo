This means at least 80% of visits to friends and relatives would now require quarantine and COVID-19 tests on return to the UK.  The UK government is telling people they should not travel to countries on the red or amber lists. \n\nThe true figure will be higher because the red, amber and green lists include countries where data on visits are grouped due to small numbers. These are listed in the data as, for example, “Other Africa”, “Other Asia”, etc. Visits to see friends and relatives in these groups of countries came to an average of just over 684,000 each summer, accounting for around 10% of visits for this purpose. \n\nThe nations of the UK have their own red, amber and green lists, which are currently identical. People who visit countries on green lists do not have to quarantine on returning to the UK. However, other countries also have their own restrictions on whether or not they would allow UK residents to visit, including with or without quarantine. \n\nThe Republic of Ireland is the only country in the top 20 for visiting friends and relatives where quarantine is not required on returning to the UK. This is because it is part of the Common Travel Area, along with the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. \n\nBetween 2016 and 2019, [29% of all overseas residents’ visits to the UK][3] during Quarter 3 were to visit friends and relatives while 23% of UK residents’ visits to other countries were for the same reason.  \n\nThis made visiting friends and relatives the second most common reason for foreign travel, after holidays. Around 44% of overseas residents’ visits to the UK was for holidays compared with 69% of UK residents’ visits overseas. \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1408/visits_total/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Nearly five times as many visits are normally made to amber list Spain as are made to Ireland\"/>\n\n[Data for top 20 countries for total visits by UK residents (XLSX, 18 KB)][4]\n\nUK residents made an average of 6.3 million visits to Spain, for any reason (holidays, visiting friends and relatives, business or study) during Quarter 3 between 2016 and 2019. This made Spain by far the most popular summer destination for UK residents. \n\nThe second most popular was France, with 3.6 million visits. Both countries are on the amber list as of 8 June 2021. \n\nAustralia is the most popular destination on the current green list, with an average of 99,000 visits by UK residents during a non-pandemic summer. The most popular destination previously on the green list was Portugal, with an average of 1.2 million visits by UK residents each third quarter. Portugal was removed from the green list with effect from 8 June 2021.   \n\nIn 2020, as the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in travel restrictions, [UK residents made an estimated 23.8 million visits abroad][5], a fall of 74% on the year before. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1408/visits_fr/datadownload.xlsx\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/leisureandtourism/articles/traveltrends/2019/relateddata\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/leisureandtourism/datasets/overseasresidentsvisitstotheuk\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1408/visits_total/datadownload.xlsx\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/leisureandtourism/articles/overseastravelandtourism2020/2021-05-24"

UK citizens resident overseas for 12 months or more coming home on leave are included in this category. Visits abroad are visits for a period of less than 12 months by people permanently resident in the UK (who may be of foreign nationality). \n \n###Spending \n\nSpend is assigned to the country where the majority of the visit took place. For example, if someone travelled to Spain via France, the entirety of the overseas spend is assigned to Spain. "
