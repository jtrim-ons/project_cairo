As health problems generally develop with age, it is reasonable to expect that older people are less able to participate in activities as freely as they once were.\n\n###Loneliness and well-being\n\nONS publication, [Insights into Loneliness][5], showed that those aged 80 and over were twice as likely to report feelings of loneliness compared with younger age groups.\n\nWhat’s more, these feelings of loneliness were found to have a strong relationship with low personal well-being ratings.\n\n###Why well-being ratings vary with age\nOur well-being may change as we move through our lives, have new experiences, and possibly change the way we look at things.\n\nThe differences might also be partly explained through socio-economic factors. Middle-aged people (between the ages of 45 and 59) report the lowest average ratings of life satisfaction and happiness and are also likely to be the generation taking on larger responsibilities, such as a career, family, mortgage and perhaps caring for an elderly relative.\n\nAs people age into the 60 to 74 generation, their well-being increases dramatically; a potential factor influencing this could be the transition into retirement and a reduction in expectations on themselves.\n\n\nNew data has also been published this week looking at how personal well-being ratings compare for different areas of the UK. You can find out what personal well-being is like in your area by exploring these interactive maps.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc238/index2.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Well-being map\"/>\n\n####Background notes:\n\n1. The following analysis is based on the Annual Population Survey Personal Well-being Three year dataset. The data covers the period April 2012 to March 2015.\n\n2. Those aged 16 and over living in private households were asked “Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?”, “Overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile?”, “Overall, how happy did you feel yesterday?”, “Overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday?” where 0 is “not at all” and 10 is “completely”.\n\n3. Differences have only been noted in text where they are statistically significant. Statistically significant differences have been assessed through non-overlapping confidence intervals. This method provides a conservative estimate of statistical significance.\n\n4. The results are not the outcome of regression analysis, trying to hold all other characteristics (for example, sex) equal. Results therefore do not tell us how important age matters to well-being ratings compared against other factors.\n\n5.
