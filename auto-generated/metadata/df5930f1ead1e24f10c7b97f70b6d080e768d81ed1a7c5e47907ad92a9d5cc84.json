Rates fell substantially during this period and this target was [reached in 2014][4].\n###Teenage pregnancies in your area\n09/03/16 11.00am - Some areas were showing the incorrect data for 2014. This was noticed shortly after publication and has now been rectified.\n\nUse this interactive map to test your perceptions of under 18 pregnancies where you live.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc311/map/map.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Maps\"/>\n\nNote: The under 16 teenage pregnancy rates by area can be found in table 5 of these [datasets][5].\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3188/Perceptions-are-not-reality-the-top-10-we-get-wrong.aspx\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/Data-Download-for-Teenage-Pregnancies1.csv\n  [3]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091212133529/http://dcsf.gov.uk/everychildmatters/healthandwellbeing/teenagepregnancy/about/strategy/\n\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/conceptionandfertilityrates/bulletins/conceptionstatistics/previousReleases\n  [5]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/conceptionandfertilityrates/datasets/conceptionstatisticsenglandandwalesreferencetables\n  [6]: mailto:vsob@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.
