The least advantaged group, called ‘routine’, includes those with occupations such as cleaners and porters.\n\n####Life expectancy by selected socioeconomic groups, England and Wales, 1982-86 and 2007-11\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc291/nssec_occ_3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Life expectancy by selected socioeconomic groups, England and Wales, 1982-86 and 2007-11\"/>\n\nSince the 1970s, men have been catching women up in terms of survival. The decline of the mining industry and the move away from physical labour and manufacturing industries towards the service sector is a likely cause, along with a reduction in the proportion of men smoking.\n\nOver the past 30 years inequalities in life expectancy by socioeconomic position have widened for both men and women with improvements in life expectancy being greater for the most advantaged.\n\nAt 5.3 years, the inequality gap was widest for women in the latest period of 2007-11. For men, the inequality gap peaked between 1997 and 2001, where the most advantaged could expect to live 7.5 years longer than the least advantaged before this slipped to 6.7 years for 2007 to 2011.\n\nThe full report includes further information on trends in individual social classes for life expectancy at age 65 as well as at birth and on trends in alternative measures of inequality.\n\nWhat is the life expectancy for your socioeconomic group?
