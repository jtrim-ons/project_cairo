Public parks or gardens, play spaces, playing fields, sports facilities, golf courses, allotments or community growing spaces, and religious grounds and cemeteries are included – but woodlands, heaths and other open spaces that people might use for recreation are not.\n\nWe found that properties very near public green spaces attracted a premium, and the more green space nearby, the higher that premium is.\n\n####The closer the green space, and the more there is, the higher the premium\nProperty price premium by distance from nearest publicly accessible green space and total amount of public green space accessible within 500 metres\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc691/line/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The closer the green space, and the more there is, the higher the premium Property price premium by distance from nearest publicly accessible green space and total amount of public green space accessible within 500 metres\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3]\n\nTo make sure our estimates compared like with like, the analysis took account of characteristics including:\n\n- type of property (for example detached, bungalow, flat)\n\n- number of bedrooms\n\n- area of home and garden\n\n- property period (for example, Victorian)\n\n- recent renovation and presence of original features\n\nWe also allowed for the effects of:\n\n- distance to transport facilities like railway stations and bus stops\n\n- distance to retail areas and workplaces\n\n- distance to nearby schools, and the inspection ratings of schools\n\n- air and noise pollution levels\n\n- socio-economic classification of area\n\nTo find out more about how we did our analysis, read [our methodology article][4].\n\n###Greatest premium paid for detached houses\n\nPublic green space boosts the prices of detached houses the most. These homes attract a 1.9% premium if they are within 100 metres of a public green space, but flats near green spaces are only 0.6% more expensive than those further away.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"324996b6\" />\n\n###Having a view of green space or water boosts prices even more\n\nHomebuyers value being near to green spaces – probably because they can use them for leisure activities like dog walking, sport and exercise. But having a view of green space or water raises house prices even more.\n\nUsing the property descriptions, and connecting words like “outlook”, “views” and “surrounded”, we identified urban houses and flats with views of green spaces – like parks and playing fields – or water, such as rivers, canals, lakes or the sea.\n\nIn 2016, having a view over a green space or water boosted house prices by an extra 1.8% – an average of £4,600.\n\n###Urban green spaces and house prices near you\n\nUse our interactive tool to find out the difference that public green spaces make to house prices near you. This tool works for urban areas in England and Wales.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc691/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Access to green spaces and urban house prices\"/>\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/valuinggreenspacesinurbanareas/ahedonicpriceapproachusingmachinelearningtechniques\n  [2]: https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/open-map-greenspace\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc691/line/datadownload.csv\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/articles/valuinggreenspacesinurbanareas/ahedonicpriceapproachusingmachinelearningtechniques"
