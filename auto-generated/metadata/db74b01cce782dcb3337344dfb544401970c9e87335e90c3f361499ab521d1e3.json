      "markdown": "It can be difficult for young people to achieve financial stability in their 20s, new analysis has shown. \n\nThose aged 22 to 29 years have become less likely to own a home, with the proportion of homeowners having fallen by 10 percentage points between 2008 and 2017 – from 37% to 27%^1^. \n\nThey’re also less likely to have money set aside. More than half (53%) of 22- to 29-year-olds had no money saved in a savings account or an Individual Savings Account (ISA) in 2014 to 2016, compared with 41% in 2008 to 2010. However, those who did had an average of £1,600 put away, up from £900.\n\nMeanwhile, young people are now less likely to be in financial debt. Around 37% had financial debt (excluding student loans from the Student Loans Company), down from 49% in 2008 to 2010. That said, those in debt owed fractionally more (£1,900), on average, than in 2008 to 2010 (£1,800).\n\nClearly, not all young people face the same financial pressures. \n\nMuch depends on where people sit on the earnings scale. The highest earning 10% of 22- to 29-year-olds were paid at least 4.3 times as much per week as the lowest earners in 2017^2^. \n\nThe gap is wider still for those with savings in savings accounts or ISAs (47%). The top 10% of savers had at least £15,000 put away in 2014 to 2016, while the bottom 10% had saved less than £100. \n\nLikewise, there are differences in levels of financial debt. Among 22 to 29 year olds with debt (37%), the 10% most indebted owed at least £14,200 in 2014 to 2016, while the 10% least indebted owed £100 or less.\n\nHow does your financial situation compare?
