The average man would earn £166.63 more per week if his unpaid work was paid, whereas the average woman would earn £259.63.\n\nSo not only do women do an average of 60% more unpaid work in terms of hours, they also tend to do the work that has a higher value.\n###Students vs Mothers\nThe average full-time student does just 12 hours of unpaid work per week compared with the average mother on maternity leave, who does 60.\n\nThe average full-time student does less than an hour of laundry and volunteering per week, 3 hours of cooking and clearing up meals and 2 hours of housework. They also transport themselves or others around - providing 5 hours of transport in a week (almost half their weekly unpaid work) and around an hour a week is spent actively engaging with a child.\n\nIn contrast, the average mother on maternity leave racks up 37 hours of active engagement with their child/children, 8 hours of cooking, 7 hours of housework, 2 hours of laundry and 6 hours of transporting themselves or others around.\n\nVolunteering is the only type of unpaid work that students do more of – providing just under half an hour of volunteering time per week.\n\n####Average hours of unpaid work done per week by students and mothers on maternity leave, UK, 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc376a/chart-3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Average hours of unpaid work done per week by students and mothers on maternity leave, UK, 2015\"/>\n[Download the data][6].\n\nAs a result, the value of their weekly unpaid work also varies massively; £762.75 for a woman on maternity leave, whereas a student does an average of £119.44.\n###Income\nThe figures also revealed that people on lower incomes tended to carry out, on average, more unpaid work than other income brackets, with some exceptions, such as transport.\n\nFor example, those on low incomes spent an average of 5.93 hours per week doing unpaid cooking, compared with 4.98 hours for those on high incomes. Those on low incomes spent an average of 3.78 hours a week doing housework, compared with 3.23 for those on high incomes.\n\nBut those on high incomes provided 7.80 hours of free transport per week, compared with 5.43 hours for those on low incomes.\n\n####Average hours of unpaid work done per week by grouped income level, UK, 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc376a/chart-4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Average hours of unpaid work done per week by grouped income level, UK, 2015\"/>\n[Download the data][7].\n\n\n\n####Unpaid work calculator: How much you could earn if someone paid you to do everyday tasks\n\nHow much work do you do in a week? Most people would just count the hours spent doing their job. But what about cooking, cleaning, ironing and volunteering?\n\nAll these tasks are classed as ‘unpaid work’ and here, using 2016 data on earnings, we can estimate how much you could earn for doing these tasks if you could only find someone to pay you.\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc376/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Unpaid work calculator: How much you could earn if someone paid you to do everyday tasks How much work do you do in a week?

Unpaid work is defined as unpaid service work which households perform for themselves but which they could pay someone else to do for them. This work is not paid, and is therefore not captured in official measures of the economy such as GDP. Examples of unpaid work include: unpaid childcare, unpaid adult care, unpaid preparation of meals, unpaid laundry, unpaid transportation of self or others, unpaid housework, unpaid DIY, unpaid gardening or unpaid volunteering."
