By 2015, this had more than doubled to 5.2 million – 16.7% of the workforce.^2^\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/sunday-trading-02.png\"/>][1]\n\nThe [Labour Force Survey][2] shows that in 1994, of those who usually work on Sunday, 6.8% were in sales occupations (which include retail sales, as well as occupations like customer services and call centres).\n\nBy 2015, this share had risen to 12.6%.^3^\n\nThe numbers of men and women usually working on Sundays in sales jobs have more than quadrupled between 1994 and 2015. By 2015, there were 382,000 women working in Sunday sales jobs compared with 265,000 men.\n\nOf the people who say they usually work on Sunday, and are in sales occupations, 59.1% were women in 2015, compared to 56.5% in 1994\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/sunday-trading-011.png\"/>][3]\n\nIn 1994, 24.3% of people usually working on Sundays were part-time, rising to 31.6% in 2015. In sales occupations, the share of part-time workers is much higher than in other occupational groups. In 2015, 58.2% of those in sales jobs who usually work on Sundays were part-time.\n\nAs well as those in sales occupations, many other professional groups have been increasingly working on Sundays.\n\nBetween 1994 and 2015, the three other occupational groups that have seen an increase in their share of employment among those people who usually work on Sunday are professional occupations, skilled trades occupations and elementary/other occupations.\n\n###Competition from online shopping\n\nBusiness secretary, Sajid Javid, who is sponsoring the bill,  explained one reason for shaking up the 20-year-old laws on Sunday trading was because it meant larger retailers could not compete with the change in shopping habits to online purchasing.\n\nThe first liberalisation of Sunday trading hours in the mid 1990s coincided with the birth of online shopping websites such as Amazon and ebay, now global conglomerates which have no opening hours.\n\n[ONS figures][4] shine a spotlight on the extent of the movement to online shopping; 77% of men and 75% of women now shop online, 2015 figures show. This is up from 57% for men and 49% for women in 2008.^4^\n\n###Slow and steady increase in retail trade\n\nUnder current rules, which came into force in 1994, larger stores are restricted to a maximum Sunday opening of six consecutive hours, between 10am and 6pm. Smaller shops can open whenever they want.\n\nSince the Sunday Trading Act came into force in July 1994, there has been a gradual increase in the proportion of retail trade overall.^5^\n\nWhen looking at sales data from the subsequent months of July, we see a small and steady annual growth.\n\nIn July 1995, a year after the Sunday Trading Act came into force, there had been a 3.9% growth, followed by 5.6% in 1996 and 6.4% 1997.\n\nAlthough this data does not confirm that Sunday trading has been responsible for the increase in sales.\n\n\nThe original data source can be found on the [ONS website.][6]\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/sunday-trading-02.png\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/sunday-trading-011.png\n  [4]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rdit2/e-commerce-and-internet-use/5-facts-relating-to-web-sales/sty-5-facts.html\n  [5]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/datasets/poundsdatatotalretailsales\n  [6]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/adhocs/005455peopleinemploymentwhousuallyworkonasundayaged16andoverukapriltojunequarter21994and2015\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.
