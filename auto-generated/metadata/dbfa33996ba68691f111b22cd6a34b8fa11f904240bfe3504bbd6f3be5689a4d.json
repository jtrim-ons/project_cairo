Between 2000 and 2015 it dropped from an average (mean) of 14.5 minutes per volunteer, per day to 13.7 minutes.\n\nThis equates to a drop from a weekly average of one hour and 42 minutes to one hour and 36 minutes per volunteer.\n###Age and volunteering - The Big Society and Beyond\nThe statistics suggest that those in the youngest age group of 16 to 24 have increased the time they devote to volunteering while those in the 25 to 34 age category have decreased their volunteering time.\n\nIn 2015 average time and participation in volunteering was higher for those aged between 16 and 24 (17 minutes per day and 51% participation) and was a noticeable rise as compared to those in the same age group in 2000 (nine minutes per day and 40% participation).\n\nIt could be that, as younger people try and secure employment, they undertake voluntary work in order to enhance their CVs, but as they embed themselves in their careers, at an older age, their focus turns to building their careers.\n\nAlso, younger people have more free time, with participation rates for students rising the most - by 12 percentage points between 2000 and 2015 – from 46% to 58%.\n\n####Average daily minutes of formal volunteering provided, by age, 2000 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc400/slope/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Average daily minutes of formal volunteering provided, by age, 2000 to 2015\"/>\n[Download the data.][4]\n\nThere have been many incarnations of volunteering schemes, promoted by a succession of governments in the UK.\n\nDavid Cameron’s Big Society initiative led to the launch of the [National Citizen Service][5] in 2011 and has seen more than 300,000 teenagers take part.\n\nHowever, both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s governments promoted citizenship-style volunteering schemes.\n\nBBC Radio One has been running a [Million Hours Campaign][6], started in 2015, aimed at encouraging young listeners to volunteer for good causes.\n###Men vs women\nOverall, women are streets ahead of their male counterparts when it comes to volunteering and when they volunteer, they do so for longer periods of time.\n\nThere was a decline in the number of minutes dedicated to voluntary work for both men and women; from 12.29 per day to 11.29 for men and a drop from 16.30 to 15.65 for women, both between 2000 and 2015.\n\n####Average daily minutes of formal volunteering provided, by gender, UK, 2000 and 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc400/bar/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Average daily minutes of formal volunteering provided, by gender, UK, 2000 and 2015\"/>\n[Download the data.][7]\n\nIn weekly terms, men put in an average of 1.26 hours in 2000, compared with 1.19 hours in 2015. For women, it was an average of 1.54 hours in 2000, compared with 1.50 in 2015.\n\nThere also seemed to be a noticeable decline from the 55 to 64 and 65+ age groups. Overall, their input dropped from 17.46 minutes per day in 2000 to 14.48 in 2015.\n\nThose in the 65 and over age group also saw their contribution drop from 19.05 minutes a day in 2000 to 13.37 in 2015\n\n\n\n####Want to know how much your volunteering time is worth?
