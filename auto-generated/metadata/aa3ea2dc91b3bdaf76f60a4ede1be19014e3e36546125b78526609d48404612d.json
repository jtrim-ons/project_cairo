For instance, self-checkouts at supermarkets are now a common sight, reducing the need to have as many employees working at checkouts. Additionally, while the overall number of jobs has increased, the majority of these are in occupations that are at low or medium risk, suggesting that the labour market may be changing to jobs that require more complex and less routine skills.\n\n#####Find out more about automation using our chat bot:\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc599/chatbot/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Job automation chatbot\"/>\n[Download the data][1]\n\nThe analysis looked at the tasks performed by people in jobs across the whole labour market, to assess the probability that some of these tasks could be replaced through automation.\n\nIt is not so much that robots are taking over, but that routine and repetitive tasks can be carried out more quickly and efficiently by an algorithm written by a human, or a machine designed for one specific function. The risk of automation tends to be higher for lower-skilled roles for this reason.\n\nWhen considering the overall risk of automation, the three occupations with the highest probability of automation are waiters and waitresses, shelf fillers and elementary sales occupations, all of which are low skilled or routine.\n\nThe three occupations at the lowest risk of automation are medical practitioners, higher education teaching professionals, and senior professionals of educational establishments. These occupations are all considered high skilled.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc599/beeswarm/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Occupation pay explorer\"/>\n[Download the data][2]\n\n###The risk of automation changes depending on where you work\n\nThis is driven by the types of jobs available in a particular area. Generally, the more jobs that require high-skilled workers in an area, the lower the risk of automation overall.\n\nDiscover the risk of automation for occupations where you work:\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc599/automation-by-region/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Probability of automation by region of place of work\"/>\n[Download the data][3]\n\n###How does the risk of a job being automated change depending on age and sex?\n\nThe ONS analysis shows that 70.2% of the roles at high risk of automation are currently held by women. In addition, people aged 20 to 24 years are most likely to be at risk of having their job automated, when compared with other age groups.\n\nYounger people are more likely to be in roles affected by job automation. Of those aged 20 to 24 years who are employed, 15.7% were in jobs at high risk of automation. The risk of job automation decreases for older workers, and is lowest for workers aged between 35 and 39 years. Just 1.3% of people in this age bracket are in roles at high risk of automation. The risk then increases from the age group 40 to 44 upwards.\n\n####Young people are more at risk of job automation\n<strong>Proportion of people at high risk of automation, by age, 2017, England</strong>\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc599/automation-by-age/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Young people are more at risk of job automation Proportion of people at high risk of automation, by age, 2017, England\"/>\n[Download the data][4]\n\nThis pattern can be explained by the fact that workers naturally obtain further skills and become more knowledgeable in their field as they progress further in their careers. When young workers enter the labour market, they may be entering part-time roles and employed in industries like sales, retail, and other roles where some degree of automation is highly likely. Many young workers may move through a range of roles before settling into a career. In addition, younger workers have more time and opportunity to retrain or change career paths.\n\nWe can partially explain the increase in the risk of automation from the age of 35 years with the change in working patterns, particularly for women. From the age of 30 years, more women work part-time, and this increases until women reach the age of 50 years, when it then steadily drops down. People who work part-time are more likely to work in roles at a higher risk of automation, but ultimately your occupation determines the probability of automation, not your working pattern.\n\n####Notes\n\nAn occupation is considered at high risk of automation when its probability of automation is above 70%.\n\nThere is a [methodology article][5] available if you want to understand more about the analysis and the methodology.\n\n1. Due to our methodology, this does not equal the total working population, or the total number of jobs, in England in 2017. A number of observations could not be included in the analysis due to missing responses in the data used.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc599/chatbot/data/data.xlsx\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc599/beeswarm/data.xlsx\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc599/automation-by-region/data/data.xlsx\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc599/automation-by-age/data.xlsx\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/theprobabilityofautomationinengland/2011and2017"
