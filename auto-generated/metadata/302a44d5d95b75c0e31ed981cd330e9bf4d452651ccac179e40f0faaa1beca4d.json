We know COVID-19 mortality is higher for men than women, it is higher for older people than younger people, and people with certain health conditions such as cancer or heart disease are more at risk.\n\nAnalysis took into account other factors that could affect how exposed people are to the coronavirus, such as where people live and some social factors, like how many people live in a household.  \n\nWe can see death rates for most ethnic minorities are higher compared to White ethnic groups. After accounting for where people live and social and economic factors (including people’s jobs, education and housing conditions), the gap lessens but is still significant. \n\n####Most minority ethnicities have a higher COVID-19 mortality rate\n\n#####Rate of death involving the coronavirus (COVID-19) by ethnic group and sex relative to the White population, England, 2 March to 28 July 2020\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1011/4models/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Statistically significant raised rates of COVID-19 mortality remained for both males and females of Black African, Black Caribbean, Indian, Pakistani and Other ethnic groups compared to the White ethnic group after taking account of demographic, socio-economic and health-related factors\"/>\n\n####Download the data\n<p><a class=\"btn btn--primary btn--bold btn--thick\" href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1011/4models/datadownload.xlsx\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">.xlsx</a></p>\n\n#####Notes:\n\n1. Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age, geography (local authority and population density), socio-economic factors (area deprivation, household composition, socio-economic position, highest qualification held, household tenure, multigenerational household flags and occupation indicators (including keyworkers and exposure to others), and health (self-reported health and disability status in March 2011, and hospital-based comorbidities since April 2017).\n2. ONS figures based on death registrations up to date that occurred between 2 March and 28 July and could be linked to the 2011 Census.\n3. Deaths were defined using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). Deaths involving COVID-19 include those with an underlying cause, or any mention, of ICD-10 codes U07.1 (COVID-19, virus identified) or U07.2 (COVID-19, virus not identified).\n4. Rate of death between 2 March and 28 July 2020.\n5. Other ethnic group encompasses Asian other, Black other, Arab, and other ethnic group categories in the classification.\n6. Error bars not crossing the x axis at value 1.0 denote a statistically significant difference in relative rates of death.\n\nAlthough ethnicity data related to COVID-19 mortality can be quite detailed, small sample sizes in some groups (for example Chinese) make it difficult to be sure of any differences or trends.\n\nSometimes this means we use broader groupings, such as \"Asian\", to include Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese and other Asian ethnicities. The larger sample size for \"Asian\" compared with Chinese means we can identify differences with more certainty. Similarly, \"White\" includes White British as well as White minority groups such as Gypsies and Irish Travellers and others.\n\nWhen we talk about \"ethnic minorities\" as a group in this article, we are referring to Asian, Black, Mixed and Other ethnic groups compared to White ethnic groups, unless otherwise stated. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/updatingethniccontrastsindeathsinvolvingthecoronaviruscovid19englandandwales/deathsoccurring2marchto28july2020"
