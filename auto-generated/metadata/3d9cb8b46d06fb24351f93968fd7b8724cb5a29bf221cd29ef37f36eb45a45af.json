However, the latest data about their relationship with alcohol might surprise you, as might the location of the teetotal capital of Great Britain.\nHere are 5 facts about drinking habits in Great Britain between 2005 and 2013.\n\n\n####1. More than one in five adults in Great Britain in 2013 said they were teetotal. The proportion of teetotal young adults (those aged 16 to 24) increased by over 40% between 2005 and 2013.\n\n<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/5-facts-about-binge-drinking-1.png\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][1]\n\n####2. The proportion of adults who binged^1^ at least once in the previous week decreased from 18% in 2005 to 15% in 2013. This is because the proportion of young adults binge drinking fell by more than a third since 2005, from 29% to 18%.\n\n<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/02/5-facts-about-binge-drinking-2.png\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][2]\n\n####3.
