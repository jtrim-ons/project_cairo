There were around 167,000 deaths from all causes in private homes in England and Wales in 2020, compared with an average of 125,000 between 2015 and 2019. \n\nThe majority of deaths due to COVID-19 (where the coronavirus was the main cause) occurred in hospitals and care homes, while many deaths from other causes, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer, happened in private homes. Our analysis shows that many of these deaths at home were people who, in a non-pandemic year, may have typically died elsewhere such as in hospital.  \n\nDeaths in hospital were 4% above the five-year average. However, if deaths due to COVID-19 are excluded, then deaths in hospitals would have been 16% lower than the average. \n\nOur first release of the finalised mortality data for 2020 shows that “excess deaths” from all causes were 14% above the five-year average in England and Wales, with the coronavirus (COVID-19) being the main reason for excess deaths. \n\nExcess deaths are the difference between the number of deaths registered in 2020 and the five-year average (2015 to 2019). Using the average gives us a comparison of how many deaths we would expect in a \"usual\" year, before the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nThere were almost 76,000 more deaths from all causes and in all locations (hospitals, care homes, private homes and elsewhere) in England and Wales in 2020 than the five-year average. COVID-19 was responsible for 97% of the excess, having not previously existed. \n\nThis analysis looks at England and Wales as a whole; trends for the two countries may differ and are shown separately in the charts and data tables.

Looking at Wales specifically, deaths not due to COVID-19 in 2020 (33,000) were slightly below the average (33,400).  \n\nThe next highest number of deaths registered in 2020 were \"dementia and Alzheimer’s disease\", \"ischaemic heart diseases\", \"cerebrovascular diseases\" (stroke) and certain types of cancer, which is similar to recent years. \n\nDeaths from different types of cancer (\"malignant neoplasms\") are recorded separately.

      "markdown": "The most significant rise in deaths based on the previous five years was from \"chronic rheumatic heart diseases\", with just under 1,100 deaths registered in 2020, 36% higher when compared with 789 a year on average between 2015 and 2019. \n\n\"Cirrhosis and other diseases of the liver\" caused almost 9,700 deaths, compared with an average of 8,300 between 2015 and 2019. Though deaths from this cause had generally been increasing over time prior to the pandemic, the rise between 2019 and 2020 was larger than seen in recent years. Proportionally, the biggest shift in deaths by this cause was in deaths in private homes, with nearly 2,400 in 2020 compared with an expected 1,800 (a rise of 31%). Analysis from Public Health England and academic studies has suggested that [alcohol consumption in higher-risk drinkers increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but more research is needed to fully understand the impact on mortality][1].  \n\nIncreases in deaths from these causes were the highest above the expected range, using z-scores. \n\nThe z-scores are a more meaningful measure than percentage changes, which can be skewed by small numbers. \n\nThere were 8,000 fewer deaths in England and Wales than expected from \"influenza and pneumonia\", likely due in part to social distancing reducing the spread.  \n\n\"Bronchitis, emphysema and other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\" and \"renal failure\" were the underlying causes of death that fell the farthest below what was expected based on their five-year averages.   \n\n####Heart diseases caused significantly more deaths than normal during 2020 \n#####Causes of death, ranked by their deviation from the 2015 to 2019 average, England and Wales, deaths registered in 2020 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1309/fig3_zscoredeaths/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Heart diseases caused significantly more deaths than normal during 2020 \"/>\n\n\n\n#####Notes: \n1.

      "markdown": "<h2 id=\"about\">About this article</h2>\n\n####Excess deaths  \n\nIn this article, “excess” deaths are defined as the difference between the number of deaths registered in 2020 and the 2015 to 2019 average. The average provides a comparison of how many deaths we would expect in a usual year. A five-year period was used because there has been relatively little year-on-year population change over the last five years (less than 1% increase each year). \n\nZ-scores demonstrate how mortality in 2020 differed from the five-year average. The Z-score is the number of standard deviations the observed number of deaths (registered in 2020) is from the average (2015 to 2019). Z-scores can be used to determine [statistical significance][1]. In this analysis, a Z-score of 0 means the number of deaths in 2020 was the same as the five-year average.  \n\n####COVID-19 deaths \n\n[The World Health Organization (WHO) defines coronaviruses][2] as \"a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)\". Between 2001 and 2018, there were 12 deaths in England and Wales due to a coronavirus infection. COVID-19 refers to the \"coronavirus disease 2019\" and is a disease caused by a specific type of coronavirus. \n\nDeaths \"due to COVID-19\" are deaths registered in England and Wales where COVID-19 was the underlying (main) cause on the death certificate. A doctor can certify the involvement of COVID-19 based on symptoms and clinical findings – a positive test result is not required. International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition ([ICD-10][3]) codes U.071, U.072, and U10.9 are included in our \"due to COVID-19\" definition. This article uses finalised mortality data for 2020, so numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 differ from figures in other publications based on provisional data, such as [weekly deaths][4]. \n\n####Causes of death \n\nThe ONS has a [short list][5] for cause of death, developed in consultation with the Department of Health and Social Care, and based on one developed by the WHO. This list uses more specific groupings than the broad group level, splitting causes such as cancer and circulatory diseases into different subtypes, to provide policymakers with enough detail to generate appropriate health policies. In this article, short list cause groups with under 1,000 deaths in 2020 were merged with other groups to reduce problems associated with small counts. For more information on the groupings used see the Definitions tab of the [accompanying dataset][6].  \n\nThis analysis focuses on the [underlying cause of death][7] only. Multiple health conditions that contributed to a death can be mentioned on the death certificate, and from these a single underlying (main) cause of death is derived using a [set of rules][8]. Information on [pre-existing conditions of people who died due to COVID-19][9] is available based on provisional data.  \n\n####Registration delays \n\nThis analysis focuses on deaths registered in 2020; there is a [delay between a death happening and it being registered][10], so some of the 2020 death registrations will have occurred in previous years. Deaths from external causes, such as accidents, violence and suicides can only be registered after investigation by a coroner. This process has been impacted by the pandemic, affecting the number of death registrations in 2020 from these causes. \n\nMore quality and methodology information is available in the [Mortality statistics in England and Wales QMI][11] and the [User Guide to Mortality Statistics][12]. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/uncertaintyandhowwemeasureit#statistical-significance\n  [2]: https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1\n  [3]: https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/latest\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatisticsjuly2017#ons-short-list-of-cause-of-death)\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/excessdeathsinenglandandwales2020final\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatisticsjuly2017#cause-of-death-coding\n  [8]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/causeofdeathcodinginmortalitystatisticssoftwarechanges/january2020\n  [9]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/monthlymortalityanalysisenglandandwales/january2021#pre-existing-conditions-of-people-whose-death-was-recorded-with-an-underlying-cause-of-covid-19-deaths-registered-in-2020\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/impactofregistrationdelaysonmortalitystatisticsinenglandandwales/2019\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/mortalitystatisticsinenglandandwalesqmi\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/methodologies/userguidetomortalitystatisticsjuly2017"
