      "title": "1. Depression and anxiety symptoms increased, while referrals to mental health services dropped during the first lockdown",
      "markdown": "<ons-chart path=\"ab29e2e6\" />\n\nIn April 2020, the number of new referrals to [Psychological Therapies (IAPT)][1] decreased by 57% (compared with April 2019).  In November 2020, the number of referrals had decreased by 9% (compared with November 2019). \n\nThe number of referrals to [NHS funded secondary mental health, learning disability and autism services][2] dropped by 31% in April 2020 (compared with April 2019). In contrast, in November 2020, referrals had increased by 6% (compared with November 2019). \n\nThis corresponds with a considerable fall in the number of [General Practice (GP) appointments][3] and referrals during the first lockdown in March 2020. It may indicate that fewer patients went to their GP, or that fewer referrals were made following GP appointments. However, it cannot be said with certainty at the moment that the lockdown was the reason for the fall in referrals to these services. \n\nThe extra measures taken to combat the coronavirus, such as a shift from GP face-to-face appointments to video or telephone meetings, may also be connected to the decline in the number of referrals. \n\nSince the beginning of lockdown, there has been a marked [increase in anxiety][4] in Great Britain, although there has been some improvement with anxiety levels since January 2021, as seen in [Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain: 26 February 2021.][5] Between 20 and 30 March 2020, average anxiety scores were 5.2 out of 10, an increase from 3.0 in the last quarter of 2019. By late June 2020, anxiety had decreased to 3.6 but still remained elevated compared with the end of 2019. \n\nIn addition, the proportion of people self-reporting symptoms of depression has almost doubled, according to [Coronavirus and the social impacts on Great Britain: 11 December 2020][6]. Between July 2019 and March 2020, 10% of adults experienced moderate to severe symptoms of depression. By June 2020, this had almost doubled to 19%. By November 2020, the proportion of adults experiencing some form of depression remained at 19%, while 17% experienced some form of anxiety. \n\n\n  [1]: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/psychological-therapies-report-on-the-use-of-iapt-services\n  [2]: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-services-monthly-statistics\n  [3]: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/appointments-in-general-practice\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/articles/coronavirusandanxietygreatbritain/3april2020to10may2020#change-in-well-being-up-to-and-during-the-pandemic\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/26february2021\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/11december2020#characteristics-of-adults-experiencing-some-form-of-depression-or-anxiety"

      "markdown": "<ons-chart path=\"6c4b96e9\" />\n\n[Download the full data][1]\n\nApril 2020 was an important month in terms of changes to the way [GPs in England conducted appointments][2] with their patients. The coronavirus (COVID-19) prompted changes in guidance for social distancing, including visits to our local surgeries.\n\nThe number of face-to-face appointments in April 2020 was less than half (from 15.9 million appointments to 7.5 million) that of March 2020. The number of home visits dropped by 42% between March and April 2020 (from 172,800 to 100,700), generally beginning to increase again from June 2020 onwards, but less than pre-pandemic levels.\n\nTelephone appointments, however, doubled between February and March 2020, from 3.3 million to 6.6 million. By January 2021, the number of people making use of telephone appointments had almost tripled to 9.6 million, compared with 3.3 million in February 2020.\n\nProvisional figures show there was also a sharp decrease in [NHS dental activities in England][3] in the period April to September 2020.\n\nFor example there was an 85% drop in the number of “units of dental activity” (treatments), from 39.1 million (April to September 2019) to  5.7 million (April to September 2020).\n\nThe data also showed that a higher proportion of the treatments were urgent cases, representing 31%  in the period April to September 2020 of all work carried out, compared with 6% in the same period of 2019.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1185/gp-appointments/datadownload.xlsx\n  [2]: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/appointments-in-general-practice\n  [3]: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/nhs-dental-statistics/2020-21-biannual-report"

It was due to come to an end in October 2020 but was extended in December 2020 until the end of April 2021.\n\nThe proportion of businesses’ workforce on furlough leave increased from 11% in early December 2020 to 20% in early February 2021. This is considerably lower than during the first national lockdown, where 30% of businesses’ workforce were on furlough leave in early June 2020 (when comparable estimates began), and 31% were on furlough leave in late April 2020 according to unweighted estimates from the [Business Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Survey.][2]\n\nThis may be because of multiple factors, including some businesses having since adapted to coronavirus (COVID-19) related restrictions. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-extends-furlough-and-loan-schemes\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/businessservices/bulletins/businessinsightsandimpactontheukeconomy/latest"

Over the same period, employment in other industries increased by 0.1%.\n\nOf the industries within travel and tourism, accommodation for visitors saw the largest percentage fall in employment (16.7%) in Quarter 3 2020. Food and beverages serving activities also saw a relatively large fall in employment (15.3%). \n\nFor Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2020, accommodation for visitors saw an even larger percentage fall in employment of 21.5%. Food and beverage serving activities saw a smaller percentage fall (2.4%), but this industry made up 40% of employment in travel and tourism in the three months to March 2020.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/tourismindustry/articles/coronavirusandtheimpactontheuktravelandtourismindustry/2021-02-15"

Therefore the estimates for patient facing roles have a larger degree of uncertainty, represented by wider credible intervals.\n\n[Download the data][1]\n\nEvidence from recent weeks suggests that the percentage of people testing positive for the coronavirus has decreased  in both [patient-facing and non-patient facing job roles][2] for both those aged under 35 years and 35 years and above.\n\nFor those in patient-facing job roles aged under 35 years, there was a decrease in testing positive for COVID-19 from 3.58% on 1 January 2021 to 1.01% on 6 February 2021. Workers in patient-facing job roles aged 35 years and over also saw a decrease from 2.68% on 1 January 2021 to 1.18% on 6 February 2021.\n\nThe trend was similar for those in non-patient facing job roles. On 1 January 2021, 2.81% of non-patient facing workers aged under 35 years tested positive for COVID-19 compared with 1.11% on 6 February 2021.
