There are many factors that could delay the effect (such as supermarkets buying stock in advance) and some businesses may choose to absorb the higher costs rather than pass them onto consumers.\n\nIn the most recent data we published, inflation (as measured by the Consumer Prices Index) rose by 1.0% in the year to September 2016.\n\nHowever, inflation has been on an upward trend since late-2015 and when analysing the cause of this month's rise, Head of Inflation Mike Prestwood said:\nThere is no explicit evidence the lower pound is pushing up the prices of everyday consumer goods.\n####UK headline rate of inflation (as measured by the Consumer Prices Index), January 2008 to May 2016 (12 month percentage change)\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc373/Chart2/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK headline rate of inflation (as measured by the Consumer Prices Index), January 2008 to May 2016Â� (12 month percentage change)\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][5]\n\nHowever, there is evidence that the fall in the pound has led to increased costs for businesses that import their production inputs - for example metal, equipment and oil.\n\nThe most recent data on input producer prices shows that they rose 7.2% in the year to September 2016.\n\n####Rate of change in input prices for businesses, UK, September 2012 to September 2016 (12 month percentage change)\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc373/Chart3/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Rate of change in input prices for businesses, UK, September 2012 to September 2016 (12 month percentage change)\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][6]\n###Higher export sales could increase growth, employment and living standards\nA fall in the pound means that UK exports will be cheaper for customers in other countries to buy. This should help UK companies increase the amount of goods and services they sell to the rest of the world which would bring more money into the UK – potentially increasing employment, growth and therefore living standards.\n\nBut there are a range of factors that affect the sale of UK exports, such as:\n\n- how well UK companies are set up to exploit export markets – for example, it can take time for a business to adapt its processes to sell overseas and find profitable opportunities where potential customers will demand its goods\n- the economic conditions in other countries – if other countries are in an economic downturn they will not have the money to spend on our goods\n- how sensitive the demand for our exports is to price – for example we export Rolls Royce cars but the demand for these is not very sensitive to price changes as they are a luxury item. This means the number sold may not significantly change as the price changes\n- the trade arrangements that exist to access markets across the world\n\nThe UK has long had success when it comes to exporting services, especially financial services. However, less success has been found in more recent years when it comes to exports of manufactured goods.\n\nWe have limited data on how export sales have performed following the fall in the pound, but it will be interesting to see what happens to this data in coming months.\n\n####The percentage of UK output (Gross Domestic Product) coming from the exports of goods and services\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc373/Chart4/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The percentage of UK output (Gross Domestic Product) coming from the exports of goods and services\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n###More visitors to the UK and a rise in the staycation?\nA fall in the value of the pound makes it cheaper for overseas visitors to come here and spend money, and more expensive for UK residents to visit places abroad.\n\nThis could mean if you opt for a 'staycation' over a holiday abroad, you may find the queues that bit longer and the traffic that bit more congested!\n\nBut again, there are many factors that can affect tourism.\n\nFor example, there has been an upward trend in the number of people visiting the UK since late 2012, but this has not been driven by the value of the pound, which had also been on an upward trend until earlier this year.\n\nInstead, the increase in visitors has been largely driven by a rise in the number of visitors from Europe, including countries that recently joined the EU. There have also been large proportional increases in visitors from China and other emerging economies who now have the money to travel further afield.\n\n####Visits to the UK, seasonally adjusted, 2006 to 2016 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc373/Chart5/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Visits to the UK, seasonally adjusted, 2006 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][8]\n\nFurthermore, nothing yet suggests that 'staycations' have risen in popularity. The number of UK residents travelling abroad has continued to rise in line with the trend seen since the economic downturn in 2008.\n\nThis may be because there is no evidence (at this stage), to show a fall in the pound has had an effect on air fares or the prices of package holidays.\n\n####UK residents' visits abroad, seasonally adjusted, 2006 to 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc373/Chart6/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"UK residents' visits abroad, seasonally adjusted, 2006 to 2016\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][9]\n\nThere is some evidence that the fall in the pound has attracted tourists on shopping sprees for luxury goods - good news if your livelihood is connected to these businesses! In July, sales of watches and jewellery were up 16.6% on the year and there was anecdotal evidence suggesting that the weaker pound was encouraging overseas visitors to buy more goods.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: <macro@ons.gov.uk>\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[Breadwinners in their 20s – how are they doing compared with previous generations?][11]\n\n[How is the welfare budget spent?][12]\n\n[Five facts about… the UK service sector][13]\n\n\n\n\nIf you like our visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up ][14]to our email alerts, selecting 'stories and infographics' under preferences.\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/data-download.csv\n  [2]: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/09/08/brexit-makes-iphone-7-and-airpods-more-expensive-in-uk-as-apple/\n  [3]: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brexit-microsoft-prices-rise-pound-slump-value-software-impact-a7378181.html\n  [4]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37755137\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/CPI-for-pounds-article.csv\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/PPI.csv\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/exports.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/tourism.csv\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/tourism.csv\n  [10]: mailto:macro@ons.gov.uk\n  [11]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/articles/breadwinnersintheir20showaretheydoingcomparedwithpreviousgenerations/2016-10-11\n  [12]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/articles/howisthewelfarebudgetspent/2016-03-16\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/articles/fivefactsabouttheukservicesector/2016-09-29\n  [14]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n"
