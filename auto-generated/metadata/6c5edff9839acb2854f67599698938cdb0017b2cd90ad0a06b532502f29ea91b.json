The youngest person to die from taking a legal high was aged 18 and between 2004 and 2013 only nine teenagers have died from this.\n\nLittle research has been carried out into the short or long-term harms of ‘legal highs’. So users are effectively acting as human guinea pigs, because they cannot be sure what substance they are actually taking, how much to take, or the effect it will have.\n####Around 60% of legal high deaths also involve another drug or alcohol\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc327/Legal_Highs/LH_split/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Around 60% of legal high deaths also involve another drug or alcohol\"/>\n\nMore than half of all legal high deaths involved multiple drugs (57% on average between 2004 and 2013), but this proportion dropped to about a third in 2013. This could be a combination of legal highs and illegal drugs or a mixture of different legal highs.\n\nWhere more than one drug is mentioned it is impossible to tell which was primarily responsible for the death.\n\n<ons-box align=\"full\">\n**Street names for 'legal highs':**<br/>\n'Legal highs' cannot be labelled as being for human consumption, so are often marketed as plant food, bath salts, incense or research chemicals:\n\n• Spice<br/>\n• Clockwork Orange<br/>\n• Bliss<br/>\n• Ivory wave<br/>\n</ons-box>\n\n\nAlcohol was involved in about 10% of legal high deaths between 2004 and 2013, though none of the 23 deaths in 2013 mentioned it.\n###Does banning a new psychoactive substance reduce deaths?\nMephedrone was one of the first legal highs to catch the media’s attention. Sometimes called ‘Meow meow’ or ‘M-Cat’ by the media, it is a [cathinone][4] substance which was controlled as a Class B substance under the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) on April 16, 2010, along with a number of other cathinones.\n\nBut deaths involving mephedrone did not immediately fall after it was banned. In fact they continued to rise for several years afterwards, peaking at 22 deaths in 2012, before falling to 12 deaths in 2013.\n\n####Deaths involving mephedrone, England and Wales, 2009 to 2013\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc327/Legal_Highs/LH_death/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Deaths involving mephedrone, England and Wales, 2009 to 2013\"/>\n\nDeaths involving mephedrone spiked between 2009 and 2012, despite evidence that mephedrone use was falling ([Crime Survey for England and Wales][5]). This could be down to people taking mephedrone in combination with other more dangerous substances, or using riskier methods to take it (eg injecting instead of snorting).\n\nIt’s also possible that prolonged use of the drug caused increasing harm, with escalating doses leading to more fatal overdoses; or it is possible that a more vulnerable group of people began using mephedrone. In addition, it may be that people stockpiled mephedrone before it was banned, which could have affected patterns of use after the ban.\n\nThere may be a complex relationship between a drug’s legal status, how widely it is used in the population and the number of deaths that occur.\n\nOnly time will tell if the blanket ban on NPS will affect the number of deaths associated with them.\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/2/contents/enacted\n  [2]: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/contents\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/04/legal-hs_v3white_vis_nologo-005.png\n  [4]: http://www.talktofrank.com/search/apachesolr_search/cathinone\n  [5]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/tables-for-drug-misuse-findings-from-the-2014-to-2015-csew\n"
