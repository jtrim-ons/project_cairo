Some may have first-hand experience of being the victim of or witness to a crime. But, although we encounter crime, whether through headlines, conversations or experience, it is easy for our perception of crime to be distorted.\n\nIt is quite common for people to believe that crime is more prevalent than it is, or occurs in different circumstances than it actually does. For instance, lots of people think their [risk of being a victim of crime is higher than it really is][1].\n\nKeep on reading to get a better understanding of what the data^1^ show is happening with crime in England and Wales.\n\nThis page was updated on 18 July 2019 to include estimates for the year ending March 2019 where possible.

Women aged 16 years and over were most likely to be killed by their partner or ex-partner in the year ending March 2018 (33% or 63 homicides). For all adult victims, no suspect was identified in 27% (175) of homicides. In these cases, it is not possible to determine if the victim knew the perpetrator.\n\n\nA statistic often quoted is that two women a week are killed by their current or former partner. This number fluctuates. The average number of women killed per week using the latest data for the year ending March 2018 is 1.2. Rounding this number causes inaccuracies in the statistics. For example, rounding this number down to one would equate to 52 women over a year, 11 less than the actual total^2^ of 63. \n\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc652/q3womenkilled/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Women homicides, England and Wales, year ending March 2019\"/>\n\n######Source: Home Office – Homicide Index\n\n[Download the data][1]\n\nUsing the same method, the average number of men killed each week by their current or former partner is 0.13.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc530/banners/svgs_section_4.svg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Banner image\" style=\"margin-bottom: -56px;max-width:100%;\">\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc652/q3womenkilled/datadownload.csv"
