They also contribute to emissions of other pollutants such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide, the latter contributing to [smog and acid rain][2].\n\nTo mark World Car Free Day, we’ve come up with 5 facts about cars.\n###1. Cars were the most used mode of daily transport in 2014\nWhen people in the UK were asked what kind of transport they used most often on a typical day, more than half (57%) reported using a car. A fifth (20%) used urban public transport, while walking was the third most common mode of daily transport (14%).\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-01.png\"/>][3]\n[Download the data][4]\n###2. In 2014, more than 40% used cars for journeys of less than 2 miles that could just as easily be walked\nOver two-fifths (42%) of people in Great Britain in 2014 agreed with the statement: ‘Many of the journeys of less than 2 miles that I now make by car I could just as easily walk’.\n\nMaking short journeys by car causes more pollutants as catalytic converters designed to reduce these pollutants do not work effectively on trips under 5 miles.\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-02.png\"/>][5]\n[Download the data][6]\n###3. In the past 20 years the number of petrol cars on the road has decreased, while diesel cars have increased\nBetween 1994 and 2014,  the number of petrol-driven cars in Great Britain decreased by 5% while diesel cars increased by 581%.\n\nThis may be due to a tax cut on diesel fuel in 2001 and a reduced vehicle tax for all cars with low carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which encouraged motorists to trade in their petrol cars for diesel vehicles.\n\nOver the same period in the UK, petrol consumption has decreased by 46% (11.7 million tonnes of oil equivalent) and diesel use has increased by 75% (10.7 million tonnes of oil equivalent).\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-03.png\"/>][7]\n[Download the data][8]\n###4. The principal air pollutant emissions from car engines have decreased over the last quarter of a century\nBetween 1990 and 2014, the 2 major air pollutant emissions from car engines, namely carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide have fallen by 91% and 76% respectively in the UK.\n\nThis was probably due to the introduction of catalytic converters fitted to cars in the early 1990s to reduce pollutants from car exhausts.\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-04.png\"/>][9]\n[Download the data][10]\n###5. Over a quarter of households do not own a car in Great Britain\nIn Great Britain, between July 2012 and June 2014, almost half of households (46%) owned a car and a further 27% of households owned 2 or more cars, while 27% of households did not own a car.\n\nCar ownership varies across Great Britain:\n\n- 51% of households in the South West owned 1 car\n\n-  36% of households in the South East owned 2 or more cars\n\n- 39% of households in London did not own a car\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-05.png\"/>][11]\n[Download the data][12]\n\n\n\nMore in the 'Five facts about ...' series:\n\n[Five facts about ...housing][13]\n\n[Five facts about...strikes][14]\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: [Environment.Accounts@ons.gov.uk][15]\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.dft.gov.uk/vca/fcb/cars-and-carbon-dioxide.asp\n  [2]: http://www.dft.gov.uk/vca/fcb/cars-and-air-pollution.asp\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-01.png\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/FACT-1.xlsx\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-02.png\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/FACT-2.xlsx\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-03.png\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/FACT-3.xlsx\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-04.png\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/FACT-4.xlsx\n  [11]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/World-Car-Free-Day_V4_pie-05.png\n  [12]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/09/FACT-5.xlsx\n  [13]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/articles/fivefactsabouthousing/2016-08-17\n  [14]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/workplacedisputesandworkingconditions/articles/fivefactsaboutstrikes/2016-08-12\n  [15]: mailto:Environment.Accounts@ons.gov.uk\n"
