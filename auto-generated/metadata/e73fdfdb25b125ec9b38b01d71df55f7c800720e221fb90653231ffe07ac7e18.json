      "markdown": "Concerns about [“inflation over target”][1]^1^ and [\"limited\" slack in the economy][3] have prompted the Bank of England to raise interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. \n\n\nAt noon today (2 November 2017), the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 7-2 in favour of raising the interest rate to 0.5%, from a record low of 0.25%.\n\nThe majority of the MPC agreed that now was the right time to raise interest rates [“to return inflation sustainably to the target][4]”.\n\nBut the Committee acknowledged that \"uncertainties associated with Brexit are weighing on domestic activity\". Some economists, including former MPC member David Blanchflower, had [warned][5] against an interest rate rise.\n###What’s changed since the last interest rate rise?\nThe last time we saw a rise in the interest rate was 5 July 2007. To put that into context, Tony Blair had recently resigned as Prime Minister and the first iPhone had just been released.\n\nOn that day, the Bank voted for a higher interest rate against a backdrop of a [“strong global economy”][6]. The rate had risen twice that year already and there was little sign of the impending financial crisis. \n\nBut between the last interest rate rise and today, the MPC had met 118 times and decided against raising interest rates on every occasion. \n\nWhen setting interest rates, the MPC considers many factors including debt, savings, inflation, economic growth, employment and wages. They’ll also look at conditions in economies and financial markets worldwide.\n\nSo how similar is the situation today compared with 2007? We’ve gathered some of the main indicators and compared the latest data points with those that were available on 5 July 2007 - when the Bank last chose to raise the interest rate.\n\nSelect higher or lower for each indicator and find out what’s changed in the last decade.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc452ir/q1/Line/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Was the rate of inflation higher or lower in 2007?\"/>\n\n[Download the data][7]\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc452ir/q2/Line/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Was the rate of economic growth higher or lower in 2007?\"/>\n\n[Download the data][8]\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc452ir/q3/Line/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Was the unemployment rate higher or lower in 2007?\"/>\n\n[Download the data][9]\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc452ir/q4/Line/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Was real pay higher or lower in 2007?\"/>\n\n[Download the data][10]\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc452ir/q5/Line/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Was the household saving ratio higher or lower in 2007?\"/>\n\n[Download the data][11]\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc452ir/q6/Line/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Was growth of consumer credit higher or lower in 2007?\"/>\n\n[Download the data][12]\n###Why has the interest rate stayed so low for so long?\nAfter rising to 5.75% in July 2007, the Bank of England base rate was subsequently cut nine times in the next two years as the financial crisis took effect.\n\nIt reached a record low of 0.5% in March 2009 and remained at that level, partly because of the long-lasting impact of the crisis, before dropping again to 0.25% in August 2016.\n###The economy took much longer to recover from this recession compared with previous ones, which kept interest rates low\nPrevious recessions, number of quarters taken for GDP to reach pre-recession level\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc452ir/chart1/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The economy took much longer to recover from this recession compared with previous ones, which kept interest rates low\"/>\n\n[Download the data][13]\n\nBut the general downward trend in interest rates goes back further than the last decade. Less than 30 years ago, the base rate was close to 15%. \n###The interest rate has fallen substantially in the last 30 years\nBank of England base rate, 1975 to 2017\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc452ir/chart2/\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The interest rate has fallen substantially in the last 30 years\"/>\n\n[Download the data][14]\n\nDespite today's rise, we're unlikely to see a substantial reversal to that trend - Mr Carney has said that any increases to the rate will be [“gradual” and “limited”][15]. \n\n\nFind out how the rise in the interest rate could affect you\n\nIf you’re saving for something, here’s a [calculator][16] to help you find out how much extra you could earn with a higher interest rate. \n\nEqually, if you’re on a variable rate mortgage, use this [calculator][17] to see how much extra you could be paying each month.\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles\n\n[What's changed since the Brexit vote?][18]\n[Are your wages keeping up with inflation?][19]\n[Understanding the UK economy][20]\n\n\n\nIf you like our Visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up to our email alerts][21], selecting ‘stories and infographics’ under preferences.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: [macro@ons.gov.uk][22]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/13/cnbc-exclusive-transcript-bank-of-england-governor-mark-carney-speaks-with-cnbcs-steve-liesman-on-power-lunch-today.html\n  [2]: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/framework/framework.aspx\n  [3]: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2017/007.aspx\n  [4]: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2017/007.aspx\n  [5]: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/26/should-interest-rates-go-up-as-brexit-approaches-experts-debate-the-data\n  [6]: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/minutes/Documents/mpc/pdf/2007/mpc0707.pdf\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/10/inflation-1.csv\n  [8]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/10/gdp.csv\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/10/unemployment.csv\n  [10]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/10/realpay.csv\n  [11]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/10/savings.csv\n  [12]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/11/consumercredit.csv\n  [13]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/11/recessionrecovery.csv\n  [14]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/10/interestrate.csv\n  [15]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41307167\n  [16]: https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/savings-calculator\n  [17]: https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/mortgage-calculator\n  [18]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/articles/whatschangedsincethebrexitvote/2017-06-23\n  [19]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/areyourwageskeepingupwithinflation/2017-06-20\n  [20]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/articles/dashboardunderstandingtheukeconomy/2017-02-22\n  [21]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n  [22]: mailto:macro@ons.gov.uk\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n1.
