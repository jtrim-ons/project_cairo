This compares with 5.2% of employees in very large businesses with 5,000+ employees. However, there are more low paid workers in large businesses in absolute terms.\n\nThe impact of the NLW on businesses will depend on a number of factors, including:\n- The number of employees who were paid below the NLW before April 1, 2016.\n- Whether or not wages made up a large part of total costs before April 1, 2016.\n\n###The NLW is likely to have the biggest impact on businesses in the accommodation and food service industry\n\n####Percentage of employees in each industry paid below the NLW before April 1, 2016, UK\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc324/chart3_industry/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of employees in each industry paid below the NLWÂ� before April 1, 2016, UK\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n\nThe industries with the highest proportions of employees paid below the NLW before April 1, 2016 were: accommodation and food services (33.2%), administrative and support services (16.9%) and wholesale and retail trade (13.4%). Therefore, businesses in these industries are more likely to feel the impact of the NLW than businesses in other industries.\n\nThe NLW is not likely to have such a big impact on businesses in the electricity, gas and steam industry, where just 0.3% of employees were paid below the NLW, or public administration and defence, where the proportion was 0.4%. It is also not likely to have much impact on the mining and quarrying industry, where the proportion was 0.5%.\n\nThe different proportions of employees earning below the NLW before April 1, 2016 is likely to be because of the different skill levels of the employees in these different industries. In the case of public administration and defence it may also be because the Government tended to pay above the NLW.\n###The NLW is likely to have a considerable impact on businesses in 'low pay industries'\nTaking a closer look at industries, analysis by the Low Pay Commission has identified several '[low pay industries][8].' More than 10% of employees in each of these industries were paid below the NLW before April 1, 2016 and so there is likely to be a considerable impact on businesses in these industries.\n\n####Percentage of employees in ‘low pay industries’ paid below the NLW before April 1, 2016, UK\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc324/chart4_lowpay/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of employees in â€˜low pay industriesâ€™ paid below the NLWÂ� before April 1, 2016, UK\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][9]\n\nThere is likely to be a particularly large impact on the cleaning, hospitality and hairdressing industries, where more than a quarter of employees were paid below the NLW before April 1, 2016.\n\n\n\n####Notes\n- The National Living Wage (NLW) of £7.20 relates to hourly pay excluding overtime and shift premium pay. Employees in the first year of an apprenticeship are not entitled to the £7.20 hourly rate. See [more][10] about the NLW.\n- All data in this article is from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), which is based on a 1% sample of employee jobs taken from HM Revenue and Customs' Pay As You Earn (PAYE) records. Consequently, individuals with more than one job may appear in the sample more than once.  Employee jobs are defined as those held by employees and not the self-employed.  In this article 'employee jobs' are referred to as 'employees.' Figures are based on employees aged 25 and over whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence.  Activities of households as employers and extraterritorial organisations are excluded from this analysis.\n- The figures in this article come from analysis of the ASHE data on wages from April 2015. Between April 2015 and April 2016 (when the NLW became law), wages grew. Therefore it is not best practise to compare 2015 wages data with the £7.20 NLW that came into force in April 2016. Instead we have used a downrated NLW of £6.83. This follows [analysis][11] by the Low Pay Commission.\n- All the data used in this article can be accessed on the [ONS website][12].\n- The pay comparison tool in this article calculates your annual salary from the information you put in. It then calculates what someone on the NLW would earn if they worked your hours, using the £7.20 NLW rate.\n\n\n\n  [1]: #Notes\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/NLW-ages-data-download.csv\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dev3/ONS_SOC_hierarchy_view.html\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dev3/ONS_SOC_hierarchy_view.html\n  [5]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/occupation-NLW-chart-data-download.csv\n  [6]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/04/Over-25s-classed-as-low-pay.csv\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/NLW-industry-data-download.csv\n  [8]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-minimum-wage-low-pay-commission-report-2014\n  [9]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/03/NLW-Low-pay-industries-data-download-.csv\n  [10]: https://www.livingwage.gov.uk/?gclid=CjwKEAjw_ci3BRDSvfjortr--DQSJADU8f2j2iUZj7h7nyMOnv1nPM7fLGhjsm_t2dnv2N7grE-ychoCB9Pw_wcB\n  [11]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/507455/10493-TSO-Low_Pay-ACCESSIBLE_05.pdf\n  [12]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/adhocs/005540annualsurveyofhoursandearningsashepercentageofemployeesearningbelow683april2015uk\n  [13]: mailto:earnings@ons.gov.uk\n"
