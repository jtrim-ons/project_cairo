Longer periods <a href=\"#methods\">out of work</a> also significantly reduce a person’s chances of finding a job in the next financial quarter.\n   \nOther factors, such as holding higher qualifications  or having completed training in the past year, were found to boost a person’s chances of returning to work.  \n\nUsing data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Labour Force Survey and the Understanding Society Longitudinal Surveys, our analysis has found that people who  struggle to return to work are more likely to experience [unemployment scarring][1] effects - the negative impacts that a period out of work has on a person’s future career prospects, earnings, and wellbeing. Findings presented in this article refer to Labour Force Survey (LFS) data unless otherwise stated.\n\nPeople less likely to find a job following time out of work could be at higher risk of being left behind as the labour market recovers from the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.  \n\nAll our estimates can be found in our [associated data tables.][2]\n\n\n  [1]: https://esrc.ukri.org/about-us/50-years-of-esrc/50-achievements/unemployment-scarring/#:~:text=Decades%20of%20research%20has%20shed,is%20harmful%20for%20one's%20health.\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/unemploymentscarringwhataffectsapersonschancesoffindingajobfollowingaperiodoutofwork"

Of these, just 24.0% had returned to work by the following financial quarter. (Figures for each quarter in the chart refer to the number of people out of work in the previous quarter who either returned to work or remained out of employment). \n\nDuring the financial crisis of 2008, the number of people out of work climbed from 2.0 million in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2007 to 2.4 million in Quarter 4 2008. The economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic are not directly comparable with those of the financial crisis. \n\nInterventions such as the government’s [Job Retention Scheme (CJRS)][1], allowing firms to furlough staff at 80% of their wages, have reduced the number of job losses during the pandemic. However, the number of people remaining out of employment still rose in the second half of 2020. Of those who hadn’t found a job by the end of 2020, those who became out of work after March represented a larger share than at the same time the previous year (38.8% and 24.9% respectively), probably reflecting the impact of the pandemic.    \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-job-retention-scheme"

This reduced to 28.5% of people who had been out of work for up to six months, and 23.3% of people who had been out of a job for six to nine months. \n\nThe trend continued as the duration out of work increased; only 7.1% people who had been out of work for between 5 and 8 years returned to work within the next three months.\n\nWhen controlling for differences in personal characteristics, how long a person’s current stint of unemployment lasted for was still found to significantly affect their likelihood of returning to work.\n\n####The more time spent out of work, the less likely someone would be to return to employment\n#####Percentage point difference in likelihood of returning to work in the next quarter, by duration out of work, 2007 - 2020\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1269/duration-total/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"The more time spent out of work, the less likely someone would be to return to employment\"/>\n\n#####Notes\n1.

This is compared with 26.8% of out-of-work non-disabled people. \n\nSeveral different factors contribute to this disparity. For example, disabled people are disproportionately older, which negatively effects a person’s chances of finding a job. \n\nHowever, when controlling for  personal characteristics, being disabled was found to be one of the strongest negative associations to people’s chances of returning to work.

This was more pronounced among people who previously worked in the hospitality sector, and among people of Asian ethnicity.\n\nThe demographics of different regions also probably affected the rates at which people returned to work. \n\nFor example, people in Northern Ireland who were out of work were more likely to hold no qualifications (25.0%) and less likely to hold degrees (9.5%) compared with the UK population.\n\nAdditionally, more than half of people out of work in Wales were disabled, which was higher than other regions and countries in the UK.

      "markdown": "<h2 id=\"methods2\">How do we identify a person’s chances of returning to work?</a></h2>\n\nData from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Understanding Society Longitudinal Surveys (USoc) allow us to identify the proportions of people out of a job who returned to work within the next three months (or 12 months in the case of the USoc). We can then see how these proportions differ by different characteristics, such as age or ethnicity. \n\nWe measured whether people who were out of a job in a particular period  had returned to employment in the next period. For our LFS analysis, the next period was one quarter later, while for the USoc data, it was one year later. \n\nIn order to understand the influence of any personal characteristic in isolation, we have used a model to control for other variables, called a fixed effects logistical regression. This shows the effect of individual characteristics on people’s likelihood of returning to work, in comparison with a reference group. \n\nFor this, we pooled all the LFS data from 2007 to 2020, which means our model refers to people who had been out of work any time between these periods. It is important to note the fluctuating labour market conditions during this time period which include times of recession and economic recovery. The same process was applied when using the USoc data from the financial year ending 2010 and financial year ending 2018.  \n  \nIdentifying which factors affect a person’s likelihood of returning to work the most helps us to understand who might be more likely to experience the effects of scarring in the future. This is particularly important because [the unemployment rate has been rising.][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/latest"
