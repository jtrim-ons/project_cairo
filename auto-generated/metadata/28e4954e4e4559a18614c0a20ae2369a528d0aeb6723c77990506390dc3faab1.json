      "markdown": "People who identify as lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) tend to rate their quality of life as lower than the UK average, ONS analysis shows.\n\n\nBy publishing this analysis as Pride takes place around the world, we mark the celebration of equality and diversity by contributing to the debate around societal inequalities in regards to sexual identity.\n\nUnderstanding how people feel about their lives and how that links with sexual identity is key to the ongoing issue of how policy makers can address these inequalities.\n\n\nAcross all positive ONS metrics of quality of life^1^, life satisfaction, happiness, and perception that things they do in life are worthwhile, people who were heterosexual or straight rated each of these aspects of quality of life higher than their LGB counterparts.\n\nPeople who identified as bisexual had the biggest well-being gap, reporting significantly higher levels of anxiety than any other group, as well as reporting lower levels of life satisfaction and happiness. Three in 10 (30%) of those who identified as bisexual reported high levels of anxiety, compared to two in 10 (19%) heterosexual or straight people.\n\n####Difference in personal well-being ratings by self-reported sexual identity compared with UK average, 3 years ending December 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc414/worthwhile/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Difference in personal well-being ratings by self-reported sexual identity compared with UK average, 3 years ending December 2015\"/>\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc414/satisfaction/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Life Satisfaction\"/>\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc414/happiness/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Happiness\"/>\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc414/anxiety/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Anxiety\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][1]\n\nNote: Lighter coloured bars, and heterosexual or straight bars are not statistically significant\n\nThose who identify as “other” or “do not know or refuse” also said they had lower life satisfaction, happiness, and worthwhile than the UK average.\n###How big is the LGB community in the UK?\nONS figures^2^ based on the 2015 [Annual Population Survey][2] suggest there are an estimated 920,000 people in the UK who identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, making up 1.7% of the population. London has the highest proportion of LGB-identifying population.\n\nAccording to the same ONS figures, more men say they identify as LGB than women, but more women than men identify as bisexual. Another 2.2 million people say they don’t know, or refuse to answer, while an estimated 206,000 identify as \"other\".\n\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/Sexual-identity-2015-new.png\"/>][3]\nNote: Numbers do not add up to 100% due to rounding\n###Discrimination may explain some of these differences\nWe don’t actually know why people belonging to the LGB community report lower quality of life. This analysis is an initial step towards highlighting differences but does not take into account a range of factors known to influence well-being when comparing groups. [Research carried out by Stonewall][4] found that one in five LGB employees experienced verbal bullying, and a quarter of them were not open to colleagues about their sexual orientation.\n\nThe National Institute of Economic and Social Research [published a report][5] which found LGB people were more likely to suffer with mental health problems. It outlined potential exposure to discrimination and harassment in relation to all aspects of life, including health service access, education, and employment.\n\nSome 12% of all hate crimes in England and Wales in 2015 to 16 were related to sexual orientation, according to [Home Office figures][6], with 7,194 sexual orientation hate crimes recorded. However, only a quarter of people who are victims of such hate crimes actually report it ([Galop’s 2016 Hate Crime Report PDF][7]), so these incidents are vastly under-reported. [Crime Survey estimates suggest][8] that between 2012 and 2015 there were, on average, 29,000 sexual orientation-related hate crimes each year.\n\n2006: ONS Sexual Identity Project launched\n\n2009: Sexual identity questions first introduced onto the Integrated Household Survey\n\n2011: First experimental statistics published on sexual identity\n\n2017: Personal well-being and sexual identity analysed together for the first time\n\n###What next?\nThere are calls to include questions on sexual identity on the 2021 Census for the first time. We are exploring this as a possible opportunity to gather more comprehensive, in-depth data that would help policy makers to have a better understanding of the LGB community in England and Wales.\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[Sexual identity in the UK in 2014][9]\n\n\n\nIf you like our Visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up][10] to our email alerts, selecting \"stories and infographics\" under preferences.\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: <QualityOfLife@ons.gov.uk> or <pop.info@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/data.csv\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/sexuality/bulletins/sexualidentityuk/2015#the-uk-population-mainly-identifies-as-heterosexual-or-straight\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/Sexual-identity-2015-new.png\n  [4]: https://www.stonewall.org.uk/sites/default/files/Gay_in_Britain__2013_.pdf\n  [5]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/inequality-among-lgbt-groups-in-the-uk-a-review-of-evidence\n  [6]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hate-crime-england-and-wales-2015-to-2016\n  [7]: http://www.galop.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-Hate-Crime-Report-2016.pdf\n  [8]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/hate-crime-england-and-wales-2014-to-2015\n  [9]: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20170726163612/https://visual.ons.gov.uk/sexual-identity-in-the-uk-2014/\n  [10]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n\n\n###Footnotes:\n\n1. The four personal well-being questions are:\n\n- overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?\n- overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile?\n- overall, how happy did you feel yesterday?\n- overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday?\n\nPeople are asked to respond on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is “not at all” and 10 is “completely”.\n\n2. We have worked to estimate how many people identify as LGB nationwide. It’s not included on the Census, and some people refuse to answer questions about their sexual identity. As such, estimates vary quite widely."
