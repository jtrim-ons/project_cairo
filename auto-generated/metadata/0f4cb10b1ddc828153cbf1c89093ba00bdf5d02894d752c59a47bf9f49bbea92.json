The EU [accounted][5] for 42% of UK car exports and 88% of imports in 2016. If the UK and EU were to trade under WTO rules, cars would face a 10% tariff. Around one-third of jobs in the car industry are in the West Midlands. This was equivalent to more than 50,000 jobs in 2015.\n\nTrade with EU countries is equally crucial for UK finance companies. The UK is a net exporter of financial services, and the EU is a significant consumer. Around £24 billion of [financial services exports][6], 45% of the total, went to the EU in 2015.\n\n####Concentration of industry, 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc421/map/maps/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Concentration of industry, 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][7]\n\nLondon is at the forefront of the UK’s service-based economy. More than one in three financial services roles are in the capital, against just 2% of manufacturing jobs.\n\nHowever, its status as a[ financial centre][8] could be under threat depending on the Brexit outcome. Several major banks are considering [moving jobs elsewhere][9] amid fears over future trade arrangements.\n\nBig companies moving away from London could have an impact on the rest of Britain. [Recent ONS figures][10] indicated that London is the largest net contributor to UK public finances. \n\nThere remains a clear industry imbalance between London and the major northern cities. This is partly behind the government’s [Northern Powerhouse][11] initiative, which aims to create more skilled jobs and boost economic growth in the North. In 2015, jobs in skilled service industries such as IT, finance and science were all far more concentrated in London than in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Leeds and Sheffield.\n\nWhereas Londoners voted strongly in favour of maintaining the status quo and remaining in the EU last June, the majority of voters in the north of England chose to leave.\n\n####Concentration of industry, 2015\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc421/charts/london/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Concentration of industry, 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][12]\n\n###Where in Britain are the sectors most associated with migrant workers?\n\nThe future of EU nationals living and working in the UK will be discussed during Article 50 negotiations. EU migrant workers are important to many sectors including hotels and restaurants, construction and public services.\n\nEmployment in hotels and restaurants is concentrated in coastal areas of Britain. West Somerset, Weymouth and Portland and the Isle of Scilly have higher than average proportions of jobs in the sector. Such local economies could face staff shortages if EU nationals were to leave en masse. More than 210,000 EU nationals were employed in UK hotels and restaurants in 2015, equivalent to 13% of the sector’s workforce.\n\n####Concentration of industry, 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc421/map/maps/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Concentration of industry, 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][13]\n\nAny changes to EU workers’ rights may also have an impact on [construction projects][14] across Britain. South Ribble, near Preston in Lancashire, had the highest concentration of construction jobs (more than four times the national average). Further south, Epping Forest, between Greater London and Essex, had nearly three times as many construction workers than the British average. Overall, there were more than 150,000 EU nationals working in construction across the UK in 2015.\n\nFinally, there were more than 300,000 EU nationals working in education, health and social care in 2015. Education professionals were highly concentrated in university towns such as Oxford and Cambridge.\n\n###Where are the sectors affected by EU funding and regulation?\n\nScientific research across Great Britain benefits from[ EU funding][15] and many EU researchers are employed by British firms and universities. Scientific research and development is crucial for discovering new medical techniques, promoting innovation and improving productivity in the economy. Brexit negotiations could have a major bearing on the sector’s future.\n\nThe East of England and the South East are hotspots for scientific research and development. Together, they accounted for more than half of employment in the sector in 2015.\n\nAgriculture and fishing are arguably most affected by EU regulation. The EU’s[ Common Agricultural Policy][16] and[ Common Fisheries Policy][17] have governed their respective industries for decades. Both sectors could therefore see changes post-Brexit.\n\nWales and Scotland have the highest concentration of jobs in agriculture, forestry and fishing. More than half of British employment in fishing and aquaculture is in Scotland, with the share in the Highlands and Islands more than 50 times its share of total employment.\n\n####Concentration of industry, 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc421/map/maps/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Concentration of industry, 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data.][18]\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n[What's changed in the year since the Brexit vote?][20]\n[Trading places: UK goods trade with EU partners][21]\n[Five facts about... the UK service sector][22]\n\nIf you like our visual.ONS content and would like to see more, please [sign up ][23]to our email alerts, selecting ‘stories and infographics’ under 'preferences.'\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/datasets/publicationtablesuktrade\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/thespatialdistributionofindustriesingreatbritain/2015\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/industryconcentration_localauthority.csv\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/adhocs/007219tradeingoodscommoditysplitbyeuandnoneucountries\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/adhocs/007219tradeingoodscommoditysplitbyeuandnoneucountries\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/adhocs/006656balanceofpaymentsannualgeographicaldatatables\n  [7]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/industryconcentration_NUTS2.csv\n  [8]: http://www.cityam.com/261819/london-holds-off-new-york-keep-its-top-spot-worlds-number\n  [9]: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-banks-idUSKBN18413K\n  [10]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/articles/countryandregionalpublicsectorfinances/2015to2016\n  [11]: http://northernpowerhouse.gov.uk/\n  [12]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/LondonvsNorth-1.csv\n  [13]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/industryconcentration_NUTS2.csv\n  [14]: http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-economics-rics-idUKKBN16M003\n  [15]: https://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/news/uk-based-researchers-are-top-recipients-latest-round-eu-funding_en\n  [16]: https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-overview_en\n  [17]: https://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp_en\n  [18]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2017/07/industryconcentration_NUTS2.csv\n  [19]: mailto:better.info@ons.gov.uk\n  [20]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/articles/whatschangedsincethebrexitvote/2017-06-23\n  [21]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/internationaltrade/articles/tradingplacesukgoodstradewitheupartners/2017-03-28\n  [22]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/articles/fivefactsabouttheukservicesector/2016-09-29\n  [23]: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/UKONS/subscribers/new\n"
