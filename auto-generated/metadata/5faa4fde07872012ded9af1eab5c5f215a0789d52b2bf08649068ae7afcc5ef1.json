In Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath Port Talbot, Burnley and Hyndburn, homes cost less than £1,000 per square metre.\n####Explore property prices per square metre across England and Wales:\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc434/map/index.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"Explore property prices per square metre across England and Wales:\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3]\n\nWe've also used this data to help you find out [Will an extension increase the value of my house?][4]\n###How big are our homes?\nThe average house sold in England and Wales in 2016 had a floor area of 104 metres squared – that’s about two-fifths the size of a tennis court, or 70 times smaller than the football pitch at Wembley.\n\nFlats averaged 49 metres squared (excluding bathrooms, corridors, hallways and landings) – that’s just over four times bigger than a typical car-parking space.\n\nTaking flats and houses together, the average size of properties sold in England and Wales in 2016 was 90 metres squared – a little smaller than the EU average, and much smaller than new homes in the United States.\n\n####Average size of homes in selected EU countries and USA^1^\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc434/floorplan/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Average size of homes in selected EU countries and USA^1^\"/>\n\n[Download the data][5]\n###Are houses getting bigger?\nNew properties are a lot bigger than existing ones: in 2016, the average new house sold was 13% bigger than the average existing house, while the average new flat was 17% bigger than the average existing flat.\n\nIn the last three years, new flats in England and Wales have increased in size by 8.5 metres squared. This could be because there is a higher proportion of maisonettes (flats with more than one storey, which tend to be larger too) in the housing market.\n####Will an extension increase the value of my house?\nWe’ve used ONS data on property prices per square metre to help you find out what extra floor space could be worth in your area.\n\nThe value of an extension will depend on many things that we haven’t allowed for here, like the quality of construction, what type of room it is, and the exact location of the property within your local authority. This calculator uses average values for houses across local authority areas.\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc434/calculator/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Will an extension increase the value of my house?
