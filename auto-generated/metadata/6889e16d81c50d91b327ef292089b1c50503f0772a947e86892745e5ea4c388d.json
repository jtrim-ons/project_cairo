      "markdown": "The impact of lockdown on economic activity has been lower in autumn and winter 2020 and early 2021 than in spring 2020, as people and businesses continue to adapt to life under coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions.  \n\nUK gross domestic product (GDP) – a measure of total economic activity – fell by 24% between February and April 2020, with the first national lockdown announced in late March. The impact of increased restrictions in subsequent lockdown periods was less severe – activity was 7.4% and 9.0% below its pre-pandemic level in November 2020 and January 2021 respectively.    \n\nWhile guidance has varied across the nations and regions of the UK at different times, we have previously identified [three main periods of public health restrictions][1]:  \n\n- spring 2020 lockdown (23 March 2020 to 13 May 2020)  \n- autumn and winter 2020 restrictions (14 October 2020 to 4 January 2021)  \n- early 2021 lockdown (from 5 January 2021)  \n\nThe [Oxford Government Response Trackers’ Stringency Index][2] assesses the different levels of restrictions across time.  \n\nThe smaller fall in economic activity under public health restrictions has coincided with increased mobility in autumn and winter 2020 and early 2021 compared with spring 2020. This is according to [Google’s indices of time spent and visits to workplaces, retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, and transit stations][3].  \n\n<ons-chart path=\"b64ef6c5\" />\n\nTogether, the trends in mobility and economic activity suggest that the economy is coping better with restrictions in early 2021 compared with when they were first introduced in spring 2020. \n\nWe look at five ways in which people and businesses have adapted to lockdowns.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/articles/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsonbehavioursduringdifferentlockdownperiodsgreatbritain/uptofebruary2021#overview-of-the-different-lockdown-periods\n  [2]: https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/\n  [3]: https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/"

      "markdown": "Businesses within industries hardest hit by lockdowns – such as arts, hospitality, construction, retail and manufacturing (which account for 22.7% of GDP) – have shown signs of adapting to public health restrictions. \n\nMore than 80% of arts, entertainment and recreation and accommodation and food businesses were temporarily closed during the spring 2020 lockdown; this had dropped to around 55% during January 2021. \n\nIn construction, around 30% of firms paused trading in spring 2020, down to less than 4% in early 2021. \n\nThese changes are likely to be a result of businesses adapting, such as hospitality companies offering takeaway only, arts organisations streaming performances online and construction firms introducing measures to make their workplaces COVID-secure.

      "markdown": "Across all industries, around 45% of the workforce have been operating from their normal place of work during the early 2021 lockdown, down from 51% during autumn and winter 2020 restrictions but up from 36% in the first national lockdown. \n\nThis is supported by our [previous analysis of behaviours during different lockdown periods][1], which shows the proportion of people travelling to work is up by around 10 percentage points in the early 2021 lockdown compared with spring 2020.  Similarly, road activity observed from [traffic camera data][2] in London and the North East of England shows an increase of cars, buses, vans and trucks on the roads in the early 2021 lockdown compared with spring 2020.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"ec5cc561\" />\n\nWhile the proportion of people working from home has remained high since spring 2020 in industries such as information and communication, and professional, scientific and technical activities, other sectors less suited to work remotely have adapted to allow their staff to return to their normal place of work. \n\nFor example, during the spring 2020 lockdown, around a third of construction staff were working on-site as the introduction of restrictions and uncertainty on their implications for the sector saw a temporary suspension of projects and closure of sites. As a result, [output in the construction sector][3] (which accounts for 6.4% of GDP) fell by 40% in April 2020 alone, the largest monthly fall on record, with an average of 42% of the construction workforce on furlough in this period. \n\nUnder the autumn and winter 2020 restrictions and the early 2021 lockdown, building activity has held up much better, helped in part by additional guidance for employers to create a COVID-secure workplace. Official estimates show that [the construction industry grew by 0.9% in January 2021][4] against the backdrop of lockdown restrictions. Around 59% of staff have been working on site and less than 5% have been placed on furlough.  \n\n####Staff returning to their normal place of work has coincided with a fall in the number of workers on furlough \n#####Proportion of UK businesses on partial or furlough leave, working at normal place of work and working remotely, by selected industries, 23 March 2020 to 21 February 2021 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1245/BICS-place_of_work/wrapper/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Proportion of UK businesses on partial or furlough leave, working at normal place of work and working remotely, by selected industries, 23 March 2020 to 21 February 2021\"/>\n\n#####Notes:  \n1.

      "markdown": "<ons-image path=\"385eff40\" />\n\nHigh-frequency consumer spending data from Revolut provide insight into the relative impact of different UK lockdowns. With Revolut customers generally younger and more metropolitan than average with a fast-growing customer base of several million in the UK, spending may not be representative of the UK macroeconomic picture – we weight to adjust for this, alongside high user-base growth, and sectoral representation.  \n\nData from Revolut suggest that spending across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland dropped to lower levels during the spring 2020 lockdown compared with subsequent periods of restrictions. Average spending across the UK as a whole fell by 56% in the spring 2020 lockdown compared with pre-pandemic, as opposed to 17% under autumn and winter 2020 restrictions (boosted by seasonal spending) and 28% during the early 2021 lockdown. \n\nThis is consistent across various categories of spending. Compared with a pre-pandemic baseline, the drops in spending on retail (including clothing and footwear shops), entertainment (pubs, restaurants and social venues) and fuel and transport (covering personal travel spend) were substantial in autumn and winter 2020 and early 2021, although less severe than compared with spring 2020. \n\nThis matches what we have seen in levels of workplace and retail and recreation mobility, which have remained higher in more recent periods of restrictions compared with spring 2020. \n\nFood and drink (including supermarkets and convenience stores) is the only category where spending has consistently remained above or around its pre-pandemic baseline across the four nations, with only Wales seeing slightly lower levels in the early 2021 lockdown.  \n\nNotably, all nations saw food and drink spending spike amid uncertainty and panic buying in the days leading up to the spring 2020 lockdown. The spikes ahead of latter restrictions were far less significant, as consumers adjusted. "

Please note that aggregating to monthly values averages over days of the week, each of which has a different levels of baseline mobility captured in early 2020.

Office for National Statistics (ONS) retail sales index is referenced to February 2020 = 100.\n\n[Data download][2]\n\nAcross the different lockdowns there have been various restrictions on non-essential retail stores, which had an impact on the number of people travelling to access these services.  However, much like overall economic activity, the impact of coronavirus restrictions on retail sales has lessened since the spring 2020 lockdown. \n\nTotal sales values dropped to 6.5% below their pre-pandemic level in January 2021, a far cry from the 23.3% fall in April 2020.  \n\nThis reduced impact is partly down to an acceleration in the long-term shift by consumers towards online shopping. The value of online retail sales has increased markedly, largely offsetting the fall in in-store sales. \n\n[Feedback from online retailers][3] suggests that non-essential store closures have helped boost sales. As a result, the share of online retail sales rose to a record 35.2% in January 2021, up from 19.5% a year earlier in January 2020 and 34.1% in May 2020. \n\nThe rise of online sales as a percentage of all retail has been consistent across sub-sectors, including food stores, that were able to remain open. With the help of click and collect services, the proportion of online food sales increased from 5.3% in February 2020 to 12.2% in January 2021.  \n\nAnd this could be a culture shift: according to our recent [Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN)][4], 21% of adults plan to continue doing more of their grocery shopping online once the pandemic is over than did so before, which rises to 33% for people shopping online for other things. \n\n####All store types have seen an increase in online as a percentage of total sales \n#####Online retail sales proportions by sector, seasonally adjusted, Great Britain, January 2020 to January 2021 \n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1245/RSI-proportion_by_sector/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Online retail sales proportions by sector, seasonally adjusted, Great Britain, index 2016=100\"/>\n\n[Data download][5]\n\n\n  [1]: https://support.google.com/covid19-mobility/answer/9824897?hl=en&ref_topic=9822927\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1245/RSI-instore_vs_online/wrapper/datadownload.csv\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/bulletins/retailsales/january2021\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain19march2021\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1245/RSI-proportion_by_sector/datadownload.csv"
