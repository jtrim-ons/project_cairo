Including deaths from other causes, the total rises to more than 58,000 excess deaths since the first COVID-19 death was registered in the week ending 13 March. \n\n[Our analysis][2] has identified a large number of non-COVID-19 excess deaths for which there are several possible explanations, including people not attending hospital for treatment.\n\n[Comparisons of mortality rates][3] show that England had the highest peak in excess deaths of the four UK nations, and the second-highest peak in Europe (behind Spain). England also had the longest continuous period of above-average mortality, resulting in the highest overall levels of excess deaths of any country in Europe.\n\nData for deaths registrations in Scotland and Northern Ireland are published separately by [National Records of Scotland (NRS)][4] and [Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA)][5].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc984/fig1alt/datadownload.xlsx\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/analysisofdeathregistrationsnotinvolvingcoronaviruscovid19englandandwales28december2019to1may2020/technicalannex\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/comparisonsofallcausemortalitybetweeneuropeancountriesandregions/januarytojune2020\n  [4]: https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/covid19stats\n  [5]: https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/weekly-deaths"

However, deaths in private homes remain 30% to 40% above what we would normally see (700 to 1,000 additional deaths per week). \n\nOver the course of the pandemic as a whole, the proportion of deaths occurring in hospitals has been lower compared with the same period in previous years (40% versus 47%).

The mortality rate among Black females was also over four times higher than that of White women, at nearly 25 deaths per 100,000 in the population.\n\nEven after [adjusting for socio-demographic factors][3] that are likely to affect risk of exposure to the virus and dying once infected, such as age and living and working conditions, the rate of death involving COVID-19 among Black males remained twice as great as that for comparable White males.\n\nWe have also looked at mortality rates by [disability][4], [religion][5], and [occupation type][6]. Compared with the rate among people of the same sex and age in England and Wales, men working in elementary occupations had the highest rate of death involving COVID-19, at 39.7 deaths per 100,000 men (421 deaths); of the specific elementary occupations, men working as security guards had the highest rate, at 74.0 deaths per 100,000 (104 deaths). \n\nElementary occupations were also found to be among those with the highest [potential exposure to COVID-19][7], alongside medical occupations.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc984/fig3/datadownload.xlsx\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyethnicgroupenglandandwales/2march2020to15may2020#age-standardised-mortality-rates-of-death-involving-covid-19-by-ethnic-group\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyethnicgroupenglandandwales/2march2020to15may2020#ethnic-group-differences-in-deaths-involving-covid-19-adjusted-for-socio-demographic-factors\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbydisabilitystatusenglandandwales/2marchto14july2020\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyreligiousgroupenglandandwales/2marchto15may2020\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/causesofdeath/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyoccupationenglandandwales/deathsregisteredbetween9marchand25may2020\n  [7]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/whichoccupationshavethehighestpotentialexposuretothecoronaviruscovid19/2020-05-11"

Prior to the recent rise, new infections reached a low point in June, which had levelled off in August.\n\nIn particular, there is clear evidence of an increase in new cases among younger age groups. \n\nWe have also published estimates of the number of people with COVID-19 in the community in England (the positivity rate) since 26 April.
