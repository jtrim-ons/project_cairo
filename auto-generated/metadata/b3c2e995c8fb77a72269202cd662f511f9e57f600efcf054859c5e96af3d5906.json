We have corrected this error. We apologise for any inconvenience.\n\n3 March 2020\n\nA correction has been made to the proportion of young people expecting to be in self-employment at somepoint in the future.

However, family time and a high income emerge as motivating factors for those who wish to be self-employed, compared with those who do not. \n\nOur data show that one in ten (9%) 22- to 30-year-olds are self-employed after leaving education. They earn less than employees on average, sometimes having worked longer hours.\n\n####Time for family and a high income are important to those who plan to work for themselves\n\n#####Percentage of 16- to 21-year-olds who consider each factor as “very important” in a future job, UK, 2015 to 2016\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc719/chart1/chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Young people see self-employment as a route to an interesting job, family time and high income\"/>\n\nNote:\n\n1.

The young self-employed are also increasingly likely to be part-time (19% compared with 14% in 2008).\n\nIncome from self-employment has fluctuated since the recession.

      "markdown": "Regardless of age, men are more likely than women to be self-employed, but the disparity is greatest among young people.\n\nMen aged 22 to 30 are twice as likely as women to work for themselves (12% compared with 6%). \n\nThis is largely explained by the male-dominated industries in which self-employment is most common, such as construction. Many builders, carpenters and other tradespeople have their own businesses.\n\n####The number of young men working for themselves in construction alone is almost equal to the total number of young women in self-employment\n\n#####Number of 22- to 30-year-olds in self-employment, UK, 2018\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc719/chart4/chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"There are almost as many self-employed men in construction as self-employed women in total\"/>\n\n[Download the data][1]\n\nHowever, the gap between men and women in self-employment is closing, with the number of self-employed women increasing at more than twice the rate of men since 2008. \n\nThis is partly because of growth in part-time self-employment. Young women working for themselves are now four times as likely as men to be part-time (40% compared with 10%). The gap in part-time working between male and female employees is smaller, with women three times as likely to work reduced hours (24% compared with 8%).\n\nWomen place a greater premium on flexible working than men, and they are more likely to become self-employed on that basis. According to our [recent analysis of families in the labour market][2], more than half of mothers (56%) said they had made a change to their employment for childcare reasons in 2018, compared with 22% of fathers. \n\n####Women are twice as likely as men to go into self-employment because of flexible working hours\n\n#####Main reason for becoming self-employed by sex, age 22 and over, UK, 2018\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc719/chart5/chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Women are twice as likely as men to choose self-employment because of flexible working hours\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc719/chart4/chart/datadownload.csv\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/familiesandthelabourmarketengland/2019\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc719/chart5/chart/datadownload.csv"

      "markdown": "A [recent report by The Entrepreneurs Network, based on a survey of 14- to 25-year-olds in Great Britain][1], found that “not knowing where to start” is the greatest barrier to young people starting a business, closely followed by “fear of failure” and “not knowing the right people”.\n\nOur data suggest that young people are more likely to be self-employed if they have someone close to them as a reference point. \n\nPeople aged 22 to 30 are twice as likely to work for themselves if the main wage-earner in their childhood household – generally their mother or father – was also self-employed.
