But this has now changed – households with a breadwinner aged 60 or over are actually the ones with the highest income these days.\n\nHowever, households with breadwinners in their 20s are technically better off (materially speaking) now than back in the mid-80s. If we apply 2015 prices to 1986, a household with a 20 something breadwinner back then was living on £17,029 whereas these days they live on £25,378.\n\nBut when we consider how today's young breadwinners are doing, we must also consider the following:\n\n###1. Housing costs: \n\nThe figures here, while accounting for inflation, do not include [housing costs][2]. This is important as these have risen greatly over this period - often much above the rate of inflation.\n\n###2. More young people are living at home:\n\nA household with a 20 something breadwinner is a rarer thing these days than in the past as there has been an increase in the number of people aged 20 to 34 living with their parents.\n\n####Number of young adults aged 20 to 34 living with their parents, UK, 1996 to 2015\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc315/chart1/line_chart/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Number of young adults aged 20 to 34 living with their parents, UK, 1996 to 2015\"/>\n\n[Download the data][3].\n\n\n\nOther Visual.ONS articles:\n\n[How has the student population changed?][4]\n\n[What's the best time for a wedding?][5]\n\n[Five facts about...housing][6]\n\n\n\nFor more information, please contact: <hie@ons.gov.uk>\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/10/incomes-new.csv\n  [2]: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/uk-house-price-index-data-downloads-july-2016\n  [3]: http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc315/chart1/line_chart/data.csv\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/articles/howhasthestudentpopulationchanged/2016-09-20\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/marriagecohabitationandcivilpartnerships/articles/whatsthebesttimeforawedding/2016-08-26\n  [6]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/articles/fivefactsabouthousing/2016-08-17\n\n\n\n####Footnotes:\n1. The average used in this analysis is the median. Disposable income is after direct taxes (such as Income Tax) and National Insurance, but before housing costs. Disposable income is equivalised to account for households of different size. The household breadwinner is the Chief Economic Supporter of the household who contributes most to household income. Only non-retired households are included here - these are households where the combined income of non-retired members amounts to more than half the total gross income of the household. 2014/15 means financial year ending March 2015 and the data is adjusted for inflation based on March 2015 National Accounts data."
