UK nationals make up the rest,  91 out of every 100 people in the population.\n\nWhen it comes to employment, nationals from EU8 and EU2 countries are the most likely of any nationality in the UK to be in work (83% of the migrant population from those groups).\n\nNon-EU nationals had the lowest proportion of people in employment (62%), reflecting the fact that many non-EU nationals are here to study. At slightly more than 1 in 10, 11% of non-EU nationals were estimated to be inactive and state study as the reason for inactivity, the highest proportion compared with other nationalities.\n\nApproximately three-quarters of nationals from the UK and EU14 countries were in employment (74% and 76% respectively). \n\n###Explore key migrant employment facts \nWhile there is no such thing as an “average” working person, we’ve pulled out the dominant employment characteristics within each nationality group - EU14, EU8, EU2, non-EU, UK.\n\n####A worker from the EU14 is most likely to…\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc405/migrationprofiles/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Key migrant employment facts\"/>\n\n###Future migrant labour from the EU\nIt’s clear that some industries and occupations are more reliant on migrant labour than others, and the relationship between workers, wages, skills, occupations and nationality is under scrutiny, particularly for workers from EU countries outside the UK as Brexit negotiations start.\n\nThat includes the manufacturing industry, which takes 11% of its workforce from the EU, as well as the  transport, construction and the distribution, hotels and restaurant industries, which each take 9% of their workforce from the EU respectively.^5^\n\nThese figures don’t include additional short-term workers, such as seasonal workers, and so the importance of EU labour in these areas may be greater still.\n\nIt’s worth noting that nationals from the EU8 and EU2 countries tend to work longer hours for less money (based on median gross hourly pay), and, in common with EU14 nationals, are more likely to be over-qualified for the roles they are doing than UK nationals, yet they are more likely to be in jobs requiring low skills. \n\nNationals from EU14 countries tend to be in jobs requiring high skills, and earn more than UK nationals.\n\nThe future relationship between the UK and workers from the EU may not be known for some time, but many employers and employees will be following discussions very closely.\n\n###Notes and definitions:\n\n###Hourly pay\n\nWhen comparing the average gross hourly pay (the amount of pay received per hour before tax, National Insurance and other deductions) by nationality, the median is chosen as the main measure; that is the data value at which 50% of data values are above it and 50% of data values are below it. \n\nWe present the median because the distribution of earnings is not symmetrical, with more people earning lower salaries than higher salaries; this is consistent with other ONS publications, such as the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), ONS’ preferred measure of earnings.\n\n\n\nMore information on migration estimates for the UK is available [here][6].

Defined as non-UK nationals\n\n2. EU14 are countries who were members of the EU prior to 2004: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. EU8 are countries who joined the EU January 2004: Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia. EU2 is Bulgaria and Romania, who joined the EU in January 2007.\n\n\tNon-EU is all other countries outside of the UK, with the exception of Cyprus, Malta and Croatia, which are known as EU Other, but are not included in this analysis as there are not enough available data to make comparisons.\n\n3. More likely means a higher percentage of people in one nationality group compared with the percentage of people in the comparison nationality group, while less likely means a lower percentage.\n\n4. The analysis is largely based on calendar year data from the Annual Population Survey (APS) for 2016 (the latest calendar year available at the time of writing).\n\n\tIn the APS, a person’s nationality is self-reported and is therefore influenced by how a person perceives their nationality.\n\n\tThe APS is designed to measure resident population stocks within the UK (the number of people living in the UK on a permanent basis). It was not designed to measure population flows (the number of people entering and leaving the UK) and should not be used as such.\n\n\tThe APS collects data from individuals in households, but does not include most communal establishments (managed accommodation such as halls of residence, hostels and care homes). This means that students resident in communal establishments will only be included in APS estimates if their parents (resident in a household) are sampled and include the absent student. The APS will include long-term migrants and some short-term migrants. It is unlikely to sample short-term migrants living in the UK for very short periods of time.\n\n\tThis could have a disproportionate effect on certain categories of overseas nationals than others. For example, students and short-term or seasonal workers from overseas (such as those working in the agricultural industry) may be more likely to stay in communal establishments or be in the UK on a short-term basis and will therefore be excluded from the sample resulting in their under-representation.\n\n\tThe analysis also draws from data available in the APS 3-year pooled dataset Jan 2013 to Dec 2015 (the most recent available); this dataset provides a larger sample on which to conduct analysis, which allows more detailed analysis to be undertaken. But, as this dataset encompasses three years it is less sensitive to more volatile trends than one year datasets.\n\n5.
