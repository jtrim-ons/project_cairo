For example, one-year survival in NHS Newham CCG (lowest survival estimate in 1998) increased by 12 percentage points between 1998 and 2013, and by 8 percentage points in NHS Leeds North CCG (highest survival estimate in 1998).\n\nThe average one-year survival increase for those CCGs ranked in the bottom 20% in 1998 increased by 13 percentage points - from 56% to 68% in 2013.\n\nThose CCGs in the top 20% in 1998 saw an 8 percentage point rise in their one-year survival estimate, from 63% to 71% in 2013. However, those in the bottom group were starting from a lower survival estimate and therefore had greater room for improvement.\n\nSome CCGs have seen dramatic changes in their survival ranking since 1998; NHS Hounslow has moved from the bottom 20% of all the CCGs to the top 20%, while NHS Swindon and NHS Scarborough & Ryedale have moved from the top 20% of survival to the bottom 20%.\n\n####Percentage point difference in one-year cancer survival estimates by CCG, England 1998 to 2013\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc316/map/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage point difference in one-year cancer survival estimates by CCG, England 1998 to 2013\"/>\n\n[Download the data][4]\n\n###Background\n\n- In 1998, Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) were responsible for the commissioning of health services, including cancer treatment. They were replaced by 211 CCGs in April 2013. This number has since been reduced to 209.\n\n- Although the current CCGs were not responsible for the commissioning of cancer services, these statistics give an indication of the relative changes in cancer survival for each CCG since 1998.\n\n- Cancer survival is only one set of information among a lot of other data available to measure the performance of the CCG. It should be seen as a guide to raise questions about the potential for improvement.\n\n- Not all cancer patients who live in the territory assigned to a CCG are registered with a GP practice included in that CCG.\n\n- Patterns of cancer occurrence by age, sex and type of cancer can shift quite quickly over time, especially in small areas. The survival estimates used in this piece are designed to reflect real change - it is intended to change only if cancer survival itself actually changes and for long-term monitoring of progress in overall cancer survival.\n\n\n\n  [1]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/cancersurvivalforclinicalcommissioninggroupsengland2014\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/02/data.csv\n  [3]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/02/dots.csv\n  [4]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/02/map.csv\n  [5]: mailto:digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk\n"
