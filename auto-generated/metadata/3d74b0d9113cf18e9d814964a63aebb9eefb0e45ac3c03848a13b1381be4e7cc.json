The proportion of unemployed graduates in this time period had averaged at 3.0%, compared with the total (overall) average unemployment rate of 4.2%.  \n\nDuring Quarter 3, (our most recent data) 4.6% of graduates were unemployed, while the overall unemployment rate was 5.1%. \n\nHowever, the unemployment rate for recent graduates remains below the non-seasonally adjusted [youth unemployment rate (for those aged 18 to 24 years), which stood at 14.6%  in Quarter 3 2020.][3]    \n\nYounger workers (those aged 18 to 24 years) have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. In the three months to July 2020, 18-to-24-year-olds experienced [the largest decrease in employment, the largest increases in unemployment and the second-largest increase in economic inactivity][4] (after workers aged 65 years and over).  \n\nThe increase in youth unemployment is linked to younger workers' tendency to work in industries that were worst affected by the pandemic, that is, accommodation and food service activities and arts, entertainment and recreation.  \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1316/graduates/datadownload.xlsx\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/graduateslabourmarketoutcomesduringthecoronaviruscovid19pandemicoccupationalswitchesandskillmismatch/2021-03-08\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/datasets/educationalstatusandlabourmarketstatusforpeopleagedfrom16to24notseasonallyadjusteda06nsa\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/uklabourmarket/september2020"

Estimates include people living in private households, and do not include those in communal establishments such as halls of residence, prisons, schools, hospitals, or care homes. \n\n2. Date of first (suspected) coronavirus episode was taken to be the earliest of: date of first positive test for the coronavirus during study follow-up; date of first self-reported positive test for the coronavirus outside of study follow-up; and date of first suspected coronavirus infection, as reported by the participant. Those with an unknown date of first (suspected) coronavirus episode are included in the estimates for ”any duration” but not for ``duration at least 12 weeks”. \n\n3. Participants who were not working or did not report an employment sector are not included in estimates broken down by employment sector. \n\n4. Pre-existing health status is self-reported by study participants rather than clinically diagnosed. From February 2021, study participants were explicitly asked to exclude any symptoms related to the coronavirus when reporting their pre-existing health status. \n\n5. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. \n\n[Download the data][1]\n\nSex, employment sector and age are among a number of characteristics that are related to rates of self-reported long COVID. \n\nLong COVID was defined as symptoms persisting for more than four weeks after the first suspected coronavirus episode that are not explained by something else. \n\n[Our analysis on the prevalence of ongoing symptoms following COVID-19 infection among people living in private households in the UK][2] showed that in the four-week period ending 6 March 2021, the prevalence rates of self-reported long COVID were greatest in people aged 35 to 49 years (2.5%), and in those aged 50 to 69 years (2.4%). \n \nAll the adult age groups had statistically significantly higher rates of self-reported long COVID than those aged between 2 and 16 years. \n\nThe data also showed that the prevalence rate was [statistically significantly][3] higher in women (1.9%) than in men (1.5%). \n\nEach factor is considered in isolation without adjusting for the effect of others, so it is not possible to infer cause-and-effect relationships from these results. Long COVID covers a broad range of symptoms such as fatigue, muscle pain, and difficulty concentrating. There is no universally agreed definition. \n\nAs well as age and sex, the data has shown that those who live in the most deprived areas experience higher rates of self-reported long COVID (2.2%), compared with those in the least deprived areas (1.4%). \n\nIn terms of differences between employment sectors, health and social care workers had the highest rates of self-reported long COVID (3.6% and 3.1% respectively). This may be the result of more exposure to the coronavirus as well as greater awareness of long COVID. \n\nPeople with self-reported, pre-existing health conditions that affected their day-to-day activities  a lot experienced a prevalence rate of self-reported long COVID of 4.0% compared with 3.4% for people whose day-to-day activities  were limited a little. They had statistically significantly higher prevalence rates of self-reported long COVID than those without limiting health conditions (2.2%). Those without any pre-existing health conditions experienced a lower rate still at 1.5%. \n\nThere was an overall estimated 1.1 million people in private UK households who reported experiencing long COVID (symptoms persisting more than four weeks after the first suspected coronavirus episode that are not explained by something else). \n\nThis was over the four-week period ending 6 March 2021; 932,000 of these people lived in England, 56,000 in Wales, 79,000 in Scotland, and 26,000 in Northern Ireland. \n\nThere were an estimated 674,000 (61.6%) people in the UK who reported having long COVID symptoms say their day-to-day activities were being adversely affected. \n\nOf those, 196,000 (17.9%) reported their day-to-day activities were limited a lot, [our data on the prevalence of ongoing symptoms][4] has shown.  \n\n \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1316/long-covid/datadownload.xlsx\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/1april2021\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologytopicsandstatisticalconcepts/uncertaintyandhowwemeasureit#statistical-significance\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/prevalenceofongoingsymptomsfollowingcoronaviruscovid19infectionintheuk/1april2021"

Single households are defined as households without children including couples without children, as well as single adults.  \n\n2. Households in Temporary Accommodation are as reported at the end of each quarter. Q1 represents 31 March, Q2 30 June, Q3 30 September, Q4 31 December. \n\n3. Data for Q4 2020 are currently provisional. \n\n4. Total figures are presented rounded to the nearest 10 households. \n\n[Download the data][1]\n\nThe number  of households in England in temporary accommodation during the coronavirus pandemic has increased since the last quarter. \n\nNewly-released data from the [Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG)(PDF, 4.18MB)][2] shows 95,370 in temporary accommodation at 31 December 2020, a 1% increase from 94,610 on 30 September 2020. It’s also an increase of 8% in the same period in 2019 from 88,310.  \n\nThis increase is driven by single adult households, which was 28,570 at 31 December 2020, up 45% on the same date in 2019. The number of households with children was 59,670 (or 63%), down 5% on the same date in 2019. This compares with 62,560 or 71% on the same date in 2019. \n\nOn 30 June 2020, the number of households in temporary accommodation  reached a peak of 98,260, a 14% increase on the same period in 2019, when there were 86,240 households in temporary accommodation. \n\nAs part of a drive ([Everyone In][3]) to get rough sleepers off the streets during the coronavirus pandemic, local authorities provided accommodation to people in their area who were rough sleeping, in shelters with shared sleeping areas or were at risk of rough sleeping. \n\nThe Everyone In response involved a significant change in the way local authority powers and duties were delivered towards single households (households without children), in the context of the pandemic.  \n\nThe number of households in temporary accommodation in England had increased annually by an average of 5.1% across all quarters in 2019. This was exceeded by the year-on-year increase in June 2020. \n\nOther aspects of [support included mortgage payment holidays][4], a [stay on possession proceedings][5] and an [extension of notice periods][6].  \n\nThis may explain why the number of households with children in temporary accommodation has decreased, in that households who took advantage of these support mechanisms avoided the prospect of becoming homeless. \n\nThere were  10,510 households in bed and breakfast accommodation on 31 December 2020. This represents a 43% increase from 7,330 at the same period in 2019. \n\nThe figures show that 88% of households in bed and breakfast accommodation were single households (households without children). This equates to 9,230 and an increase of 270 from the previous quarter. \n\nWales, Scotland and Northern Ireland  also experienced an increase in households in temporary accommodation. \n\n[In Wales, 2,324 households were placed in temporary accommodation][7] at 31 March 2020, an increase of 4% on March 2019. The data refers to homelessness as defined by the Housing (Wales) Act 2014. \n\nNational lockdown measures went into effect on 23 March 2020, which has affected the total of households in temporary accommodation in Wales at 31 March 2020. [More recent information on homelessness is available][8], which is not comparable with statutory homelessness data. \n\nIn [Northern Ireland][9], the number of placements in temporary accommodation more-than doubled, from 2,175 in July to December 2019, to 4,677 in July to December 2020.  \n\nIn [Scotland][10], at 30 September 2020, there was a 24% increase in the number of  households in temporary accommodation compared with the same period in 2019.   \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1316/homelessness-TA/datadownload.xlsx\n  [2]: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/979393/Statutory_homelessness_release_Oct-Dec_2020.pdf\n  [3]: https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9057/\n  [4]: https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/dealing-financial-difficulties-coronavirus\n  [5]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-and-renting-guidance-for-landlords-tenants-and-local-authorities/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-landlords-and-tenants\n  [6]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-and-renting-guidance-for-landlords-tenants-and-local-authorities/technical-guidance-on-eviction-notices\n  [7]: https://gov.wales/homelessness-april-2019-march-2020\n  [8]: https://gov.wales/homelessness-accommodation-provision-and-rough-sleeping\n  [9]: https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/system/files/publications/communities/ni-homelessness-bulletin-jul-dec-2020.pdf\n  [10]: https://www.gov.scot/publications/homelessness-scotland-update-30-september-2020/"

Question: \"In which ways is coronavirus affecting your life?\". \n\n2. Respondents asked to select all that apply. \n\n3. Base population for percentage: disabled or non-disabled people. \n\n4. February 2021 refers to the collection period 3 to 28 February. See Section 9: Data sources and quality in the [latest publication][1] for more information on the dates covered within this period.  \n\n5. Lower and upper 95% confidence levels form a confidence interval, which is a measure of the statistical precision of an estimate and shows the range of uncertainty around the calculated estimate. As a general rule, if the confidence interval around one estimate overlaps with the interval around another, we cannot say with certainty that there is more than a chance difference between the two estimates. \n\n[Download the data][2]\n\nMore disabled people continue to be worried about the effect of the coronavirus than non-disabled people. \n\nData published in the [Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (February 2021][3]), showed the social impact of the coronavirus pandemic on disabled people in Great Britain between the 3 to 28 February 2021.  \n\nWhile a larger proportion of disabled people (78%) than non-disabled people (69%) said they were worried (very or somewhat) about the effect of the coronavirus on their lives, the proportions were smaller compared with September 2020. \n\nIn September 2020, 83% of disabled people said they were worried about the effect that the coronavirus was having on their lives, compared with 71% of non-disabled people. \n\nThere was also a difference in the way in which the coronavirus impacted on disabled and non-disabled people. \n\nFor disabled people in February 2021, the impact of the virus on their well-being (65%) and lack of freedom and independence (62%) were most often mentioned as ways their lives were affected. For non-disabled people, lack of freedom and independence (68%) was the area of life most affected.  \n\nDisabled people more often indicated coronavirus had affected their life than non-disabled people in ways such as their health (35% for disabled people, compared with 12% for non-disabled people), access to healthcare for non-coronavirus related issues (40% compared with 19%), well-being (65% compared with 50%) and access to groceries, medication and essentials (27% compared with 12%). \n\nNon-disabled people more often said in February 2021 than in September 2020 that coronavirus affected their well-being (50% compared with 42%), life events (45% compared with 39%), exercise routine (35% compared with 23%) and relationships (29% compared to 21%).   \n\nSeparate data from the [NISRA Coronavirus (COVID-19) Opinion Survey Phases 1 to 10][4] showed that in Northern Ireland, people with a limiting longstanding illness reported significantly lower rates of life satisfaction, feelings of worthwhile and happiness than people without a limiting longstanding illness. They also had higher rates of anxiety.  \n\nAlthough the data - which covers 21 April 2020 to 3 April 2021 -  is not directly comparable with the rest of the UK, it is in line with trends across the UK documenting poorer well-being outcomes for disabled people. \n\n#####Note: \n\nThe term \"limiting longstanding illness\" has been used as a proxy to produce data on individuals considered to be disabled according to the Disability Discrimination Act. The act considers a person disabled if they have a longstanding physical or mental condition or disability that has lasted or is likely to last at least 12 months, and if this condition or disability has a substantial adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/disability/articles/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsondisabledpeopleingreatbritain/february2021#data-sources-and-quality\n  [2]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1316/disabled/datadownload.xlsx\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsondisabledpeopleingreatbritainfebruary2021\n  [4]: https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/nisra-coronavirus-covid-19-opinion-survey"
