Some people in poor health may have been hesitant initially because of pre-existing medical conditions or concerns about side-effects.  \n\nThe widespread fall in hesitancy, regardless of self-reported health, coincides with growing [evidence that vaccines are effective in preventing hospitalisation from COVID-19][2], as well as changes to guidance for those who are double-vaccinated. Fully vaccinated adults are now able to [return from amber list countries without quarantining][3], and by 16 August they will [no longer need to self-isolate][4] when identified as a close contact of someone with COVID-19. \n\nOur analysis hasn’t tested whether falls in hesitancy are driven by bad health or a combination of factors. \n\n####People in self-reported bad health are now equally or less vaccine hesitant than those in good health \n#####Percentage of adults reporting vaccine hesitancy by self-reported health, English regions and Scotland, 7 January to 28 March and 28 April to 18 July 2021\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1507/slope-multiple/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of adults reporting vaccine hesitancy by self-reported health, English regions, Scotland and Wales, 7 January to 28 March and 28 April to 18 July 2021\"/>\n\n[Data on coronavirus vaccine hesitancy by self-reported health (XLSX, 22KB)][5]\n\n\n  [2]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-hospitalisation-from-delta-variant\n  [3]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/quarantine-free-travel-to-resume-on-19-july-for-fully-vaccinated-passengers-returning-from-amber-list-countries\n  [4]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/self-isolation-to-be-eased-for-fully-vaccinated-adults-in-step-4\n  [5]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1507/slope-multiple/datadownload.xlsx"

      "markdown": "As of 19 July, [all adults aged 18 years and over in the UK had been offered at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine][1]. \n\nThe latest UK-wide data (up to 1 August 2021) show that 88.6% of the adult population has received one dose of a vaccine, with 72.7% double-vaccinated. Numbers for the four UK nations are available on the [GOV.UK coronavirus dashboard][2].  \n\nEstimates of vaccine uptake among those aged 50 years and over are available for English regions in [Public Health England’s COVID-19 Health Inequalities Monitoring for England (CHIME) tool][3].  \n\nThe most recent data, up to the end of June 2021, show that one in nine (11%) adults aged 50 years and over in London have not received a coronavirus vaccine, twice the rate of any other English region. \n\nThe figures cover residents in England who could be linked to the 2011 Census and General Practice (GP) data. They should not be used to represent the total number of vaccinations, and may also differ from the administrative data on vaccinations published by NHS England weekly. \n\n####The rate of not receiving a vaccine among over-50s is twice as high in London as anywhere else \n#####Percentage of adults aged 50 years and over that have not received a coronavirus vaccine, English regions, end of June compared with end of March 2021\n\n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1507/dot-plot-jiggle/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"Percentage of adults aged 50 years and over that have not received a coronavirus vaccine, English regions, end of June compared with end of March 2021\"/>\n\n[Data on adults aged 50 years and over that have not received a coronavirus vaccine (XLSX, 18KB)][4]\n\nAmong ethnic groups, the highest rate of not receiving a vaccine was in London for Black Caribbean adults (32%) and West Midlands for those of Black African ethnicity (30%). \n\nThose who have never worked and are long-term unemployed were more likely to have not had a vaccine than those in employment. The highest rate of non-vaccination was in London (21%). \n\nJust as rates of vaccine hesitancy increase with levels of deprivation, the likelihood of not having a vaccine also rises in more deprived areas across all English regions. Around one in six (17%) over-50s living in the most deprived parts of London had not received a vaccine by the end of June 2021 (the highest of any region). \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/every-adult-in-uk-offered-covid-19-vaccine\n  [2]: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/vaccinations\n  [3]: https://analytics.phe.gov.uk/apps/chime/\n  [4]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/dvc1507/dot-plot-jiggle/datadownload.xlsx"
