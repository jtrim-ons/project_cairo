However, these numbers will be an underestimate of those who had respiratory disease, at or around the time of death, as it is not always recorded as the underlying cause of death.\n\nThe predominant circulating flu virus in 2015 was influenza A(H3N2) a strain known to predominantly affect older people.\n\nThere were numerous reported outbreaks in care homes, higher than expected numbers of admissions to hospital and intensive care for flu and evidence that the flu vaccine was less effective than in previous years.\n\nThe peak in influenza admissions to intensive care occurred in January, at the same time as the peak increase in deaths.\n\nDementia and Alzheimer's disease deaths were well above the five-year average throughout the year, particularly so between January and March 2015, and have shown a general upward trend over the last decade. The reasons for this may be partly related to attempts across the health system to [improve the diagnosis of people][3] with dementia.\n\nHowever, it may be related to the greater vulnerability to respiratory diseases of people with these conditions, difficulties with self-care and falls, all of which may be more important in winter months.\n\nGenerally more than a third of deaths with an underlying cause of dementia or Alzheimer's disease also have a respiratory disease mentioned on the death certificate. This was true of deaths in 2015.\n###There has been a fall in life expectancy\nPeriod life expectancy[^1^](#notes) Life expectancy figures are based on a provisional extract of deaths and population figures for 2015, taken from the ONS series of Principal Population Projections.\n\nAn increase in the number of deaths has a direct impact on the provisional life expectancy at birth for England and Wales. This has dropped by 0.2 years for males (to 79.3 years) and 0.3 years for females (to 82.9 years) since 2014, according to provisional mortality rates for 2015.\n\n\n\nFor information on diagnosis of dementia, click on [Challenge on Dementia][4] and on the [ Mandate from the Government to the NHS][5].\n\n<h4 id=\"notes\">Notes:</h4>\n1 - Life expectancy figures are based on a provisional extract of deaths and population figures for 2015, taken from the ONS series of Principal Population Projections.\n\n Death rates are likely to change in the future, so period life expectancy does not therefore give the number of years someone could actually expect to live.\n\n Official life expectancy figures for 2015 will be calculated by ONS using the final annual release of 2015 deaths and mid-year population estimates for 2015, published in the summer of 2016.\n\n Period life expectancies are a useful summary measure of mortality rates as they are age-standardised, and therefore take into account differences in the age structure of populations, allowing valid comparisons to be made over time and between different geographical areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/04/Figure-1.xls\n  [2]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2016/04/Figure-3.xls\n  [3]: https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/dementia/\n  [4]: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prime-ministers-challenge-on-dementia-2020\n  [5]: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/486818/mndate-NHSE-15_16.pdf\n  [6]: mailto:digitalcontent@ons.gov.uk\n"
