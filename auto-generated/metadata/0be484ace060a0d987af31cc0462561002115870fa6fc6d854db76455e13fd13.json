UK Older People's Day is also held on October 1 each year, to celebrate the contributions of older people to society.\n\nTo mark IDOP 2015, here are nine facts you may not know about older people.\n\n####1. There were more than half a million people aged 90 and over living in the UK in 2014, almost triple the number thirty years ago.\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/09/Older-Peoples-Day-01.png\"/>][2]\n[Download the data][3]\n\n####2. For every 100 people aged 90 and over in 2014, 29 were male and 71 were female.\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/09/Older-Peoples-Day-02.png\"/>][4]\n\n####3. The number of centenarians (people aged 100 and over) living in the UK has risen by 72% over the last decade to 14,450 in 2014. \n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/09/Older-Peoples-Day-03.png\"/>][5]\n[Download the data][6]\n\n####4. Male life expectancy has increased from 70.8 in 1980-82 to 79.1 in 2012-14. Female life expectancy has increased from 76.8 to 82.8 during the same period.\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/09/Older-Peoples-Day-04.png\"/>][7]\n\n####5. The most common age of death was 86 years for men and 89 years for women. This is higher than current average life expectancy at birth.\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/09/Older-Peoples-Day-05.png\"/>][8]\n\n####6. Men aged 85 in 2012-14 could expect to live to 90.8 whereas women could expect to live to 91.8.\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/09/Older-Peoples-Day-06.png\"/>][9]\n\n####7.

A third of those over 80 reported very high levels of life satisfaction in 2014 to 2015.\n[<img src=\"https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/10/Older-Peoples-Day-Visual-08.png\"/>][11]\n\n####9.
