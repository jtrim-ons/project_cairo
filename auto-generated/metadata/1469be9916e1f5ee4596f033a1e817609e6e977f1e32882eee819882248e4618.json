      "markdown": "Washing hands, covering faces and keeping two metres apart (“hands, face, space”) became a way of life during the coronavirus pandemic. And during lockdowns, so did keeping away from friends and loved ones.\n\n[In a study][1], the Office for National Statistics (ONS) sought to understand what influences people to follow the guidance or not, and how this differs between social backgrounds – students, young people, ethnic minorities, parents with dependent children, high income workers and low-income workers. We commissioned [IFF Research][2] to interview 180 people between 23 December 2020 and 22 January 2021, 90 of whom also kept diaries. \n\nOn the whole, people's compliance was high but there were some factors that led to some participants not complying, which we explore below. From fear of the virus and a desire to protect the vulnerable, to concerns about their mental health and confusion about what they should and should not do, several factors influenced how people followed the guidance. The challenge is also reflected in [data from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) from 7 to 31 January 2021][3]. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/compliancewithcoronaviruscovid19guidelines\n  [2]: https://www.iffresearch.com/compliance-coronavirus-guidance/\n  [3]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/adhocs/13113coronavirusandcompliancewithguidelinesingreatbritainjanuary2021"

      "markdown": "Guidance on mixing with friends and family, which has changed at different stages of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, was something some of the people interviewed struggled with. While many were aware of the need to wash hands, cover their faces indoors in public, and keep their distance from others, some did not see why they could not meet friends and family indoors at home.\n\n<ons-quote content=\"Social distancing goes out of the window when we meet up.

This fell to 74% among young people (aged 18 to 24 years), 83% among ethnic minority groups and 86% among those on low incomes (£8,700 a year or less).  \n\nThere was high compliance across all the groups for wearing face coverings, with an average of 96% of all adults that had left their home in the past seven days saying they used them. The lowest compliance with face coverings appeared to be among 18-to 24-year-olds at 93%. Among those who left home in the past seven days, young people also appeared to be the least likely to say they always or often washed their hands after returning home, at 84% compared with an average for all adults of 90%. \n\nEstimates in the OPN are provided from a sample survey.

Questions: In the past seven days, when you have met up with people outside your household or support bubble, how often have you maintained social distancing?; How often did you wash your hands with soap and water straight away after returning home from a public place?; Have you used a face covering when outside your home to help slow the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19)? \n2. Base: adults, aged 18 years and over who left their home in the past seven days (for handwashing and face coverings) and  those who have met up with someone outside their household or support bubble, inside or outside (for social distancing). \n3.

They therefore concluded meeting with friends was “safe enough”, even though it was not permitted.  \n\nData from the OPN show that compliance with the guidance on physical contact was high across all social groups. However, among those who left their home in the past seven days, a lower percentage of young people (aged 18 to 24 years) and ethnic minority groups (both 89%) avoided physical contact when outside their home, compared to 93% of all adults. \n\n####In all groups, around 9 out of 10 people avoided physical contact with others when outside their home \nPercentage of adults avoiding physical contact, Great Britain, 7 to 31 January 2021 \n<ons-interactive url=\"/visualisations/dvc1285/physical_contact/wrapper/index.html\" full-width=\"false\" title=\"In all groups, around 9 out of 10 people avoided physical contact with others when outside their home \"/>\n\n#####Notes \n1.

      "markdown": "###About this article\n\nThis article is drawn from a qualitative analysis, intended to understand participants’ circumstances, attitudes and behaviour, rather than to be “representative” or measure the incidence of attitudes or behaviours. The term “many” is used when a view or behaviour is fairly widespread within a particular group of participants and “few” indicates findings applied only to a handful. “Some” indicates a middle ground between “many” and “few”. \n\nWe have included data from the [weekly Opinions and Lifestyle Survey (OPN) from 7 to 31 January][1], around the time that the interviews took place, to provide context for the quotes from interviewees. This analysis of compliance indicators was provided by age, ethnicity, income and parental status.  \n\n####Footnotes\n<br>\n#####Income \n\nThe study defined high-income participants as those with an annual household income of £47,000 a year after tax. The OPN's highest income bracket is an individual's income of £36,500 a year or more before tax. For low-income workers, the study defines this as a household income of £18,000 a year after tax, while the OPN’s lowest income bracket was an individual who had an income of £8,700 a year or less before tax. Personal annual gross income is self-reported on the OPN survey and therefore should be treated with caution. A respondent’s income information does not represent equivalised household income, which takes into account all income from all household members, and adjusts for that fact that households with more people will need a higher income to achieve the same standard of living as households with fewer members.   \n\n#####Parental status \n\nA parent in the study is defined as someone who was a parent or legal guardian of one or more children aged under 16 years, while in the OPN data an adult is defined as a parent if they are the parent of a dependent child living in their household. This includes children and stepchildren. A dependent child is someone under the age of 16 years or someone who is aged 16 to 18 years, has never been married and is in full-time education.\n\n#####Ethnicity \n\nThe ethnicity disaggregation used has been chosen to provide the most granular breakdown possible, while producing robust estimates based on sample sizes, in line with the [Government Statistical Service Ethnicity Harmonised standard][2]. \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/latest\n  [2]: https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/ethnicity/"
