That is, that the number of people immigrating to the country is exactly equal to the number of people emigrating at each age.\n###How could the age structure of the population vary?\nThe different assumptions affect the age structure of the population and can be seen using interactive population pyramids.\n<ons-interactive url=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/nesscontent/dvc219/pyramids/pyramids.html\" full-width=\"true\" title=\"How could the age structure of the population vary?\"/>\n\nIt is important to remember that these population projections are not forecasts - they don't take into account possible future changes in government policy - and that the High Population and Low Population variants do not set the upper and lower limits on how the population could possibly change in the future.\n\nYou can find more information on variant projections in the [background and methodology report][2], along with full [results of the projections and an explanation of the main findings][3].\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://static.ons.gov.uk/visual/2015/10/data-download.csv\n  [2]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/npp/national-population-projections/2014-based-projections/rpt-1-background-and-methodology.html\n  [3]: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/npp/national-population-projections/2014-based-projections/index.html\n\n"
